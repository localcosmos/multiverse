Reside in their dens for up to several weeks but eventually will move on to a new area, probably when resources around the den become depleted.</p><p>Octopuses are well-known for their intelligence, adaptability and complex behaviour. Because they have no internal skeleton but essentially consist only of flexible muscle, they can squeeze into the tightest spaces. Their skin contains specialised pigment cells called chromatophores, which enable rapid changes in colour and texture for camouflage, communication, or warning displays. Have a short life-span and are thought to live between 12-15 months.</p><p>Prey on a variety of food and play important roles as both predators as well as prey in South African coastal and kelp forest ecosystems. While a lot of research has been carried out on other species in the <i>Octopus vulgaris </i>species complex, little published information exists on the South African lineage and much of our knowledge comes from our own observations in the field.</p><p>Octopuses are present in the kelp forest all year round, but young (probably around 200-300g) animals appear in larger numbers in early summer (November/December). The observant diver can recognise little dens appearing especially in the coarse sand as young octopuses have less trouble excavating sandy dens than large adults. By this they also spatially segregate from larger individuals on the reefs that are potential threats, as octopuses can occasionally be cannibalistic. Young octopuses like to predate on bivalves, gastropods, polychaetes or crustaceans that are buried in the sediment around them. They do this by pushing and extending one or more of their arms deeply into the sand to excavate a shell.</p><p>Growing quickly, larger octopuses tend to move to dens in rocky substrate, which are often the same dens used by a new generation of octopuses every year. Octopuses are specialising generalists, and we have observed different animals predating completely different prey items, even if their dens are only a meter apart. Some individuals predominately eat Abalone <i>Haliotes midae</i>, whereas another hunts Rock crabs or Rock lobsters and another prefers a varied diet and takes any invertebrate. Smith (2003) identified 39 prey species taken by octopuses in False Bay, and prey size and prey diversity increased with increasing octopus\u2019 size. We have since found numerous additional prey species taken by octopuses, such as the Giant chiton <i>Dinoplax gigas. </i>Octopuses in False Bay take more than 50 species of prey and play an important role in the prey species\u2019 population ecology, which have ecological knock-on and control effects to the food web. &nbsp;</p><p>It is often described in the literature that octopuses are anti-social animals, but in our observations, individuals often occupy dens that are right next to each other, being aware and tolerating of their neighbours. Apart from high food availability in the Great African Seaforest, individuals having personal, preferred diets and developing their very own hunting strategies may allow for high octopus densities. We sometimes observe four or five animals in an area of only a few square meters, and it is possible to see 20\u201330 animals at a dive site. Individuals can have extremely different personalities also in the way of how they approach and interact with divers.</p><p>Having gained global fame and recognition through our <i>My Octopus Teacher </i>documentary, it may be surprising that the taxonomy of this species, like for so many South African marine invertebrates, has remained unresolved. The name <i>Octopus vulgaris</i> is problematic for the South African population and detailed studies must be carried out to separate it from the European counterpart. Unresolved and poor taxonomy is a major concern for the more than 300 species that occur globally, as cephalopods are under increased fishing pressure, but fisheries management stays in the unclear of which species are being caught. Right now, octopuses caught in False Bay are sold globally and marketed in Europe as <i>Octopus vulgaris</i>, which is not an unsatisfying situation. The current catches of octopus in False Bay vary around 70 metric tons per year (if each octopus is 1 kg on average, then 70t means 70.000 animals).&nbsp;</p><p>Preliminary research through the M.Sc. project by Gareth Fee provides both morphological as well as genetic support to give the South African species its own name.</p>", "taxon_text_5_9108": "<p>As a species octopuses are generalist hunters that feed on almost anything they can catch. In False Bay octopuses prey on multiple invertebrates of over 50 different species, more rarely on fish or other vertebrates. The most common and preferred prey species are Rock crabs, Rock lobsters and Abalone but individuals can become highly specialised in food that is readily available in the direct environment of their den.</p><p>Fast moving prey such as Rock lobster are first ambushed and then caught by casting the arm web over the prey after which the victim is injected with a cocktail of a potent venom that both kills the Rock lobster and simultaneously digests and liquifies its muscular tissue. The octopus then cracks open the exoskeleton with its bird-like beak and essentially \u2018drinks\u2019 the content.</p><p>When catching shelled molluscs octopuses can use two strategies. Either they pull their victim directly off the substrate or open shells by force to access the meat directly, or, if this fails and the meat is still inaccessible, they have to drill through the shell using their salivary papilla to inject a venom. Depending on shell thickness this takes up to several hours. Shells are often taken back to the den and drilled in safety. The precision of drilling is of interest as a specific shell region is targeted under which certain muscles or organs lie. For his B.Sc. (Honours) thesis, Gareth Fee could show that octopuses drilled with great precision into the Helmet snail, but that in the Abalone with has a huge adductor muscle, octopuses drilled into any middle shell part. Once the octopus gets to the fleshy meat it is torn apart with the beak and broken down and scraped off with the radula, which is a muscular tongue with hundreds of tiny teeth.</p><p>Different to other habitats in which &nbsp;benthic octopuses stay on the seafloor, in the Great African Seaforest octopuses have a three-dimensional ecosystem to explore and exploit. A number of prey species live on the kelp such as mussels that settle on the kelp heads or the specialieed Kelp limpet <i>Cymbula compressa </i>on the kelp stipes. Octopuses are the main predator of Kelp limpets and spend large amounts of their time foraging in the canopy. We realised this during a research project collecting limpet shells from the beach. At some beaches with high octopus abundance in adjacent waters 50% of Kelp limpet shells have octopus drill holes.&nbsp;</p><p>Foraging activity is probably linked to predator density and can be adapted. Octopuses in the Great African Seaforest are a main prey of Pyjama catsharks, and to a lesser amount also to seals. Animals that have lost an arm to a shark predation are frequently observed, but this grows back within several months. Males are highly careful of how they use and project their third right hectocotylised arm as loosing or damaging it could mean a failure in reproduction. In addition to complex visual camouflage, octopuses have several strategies to avoid predation, which includes a chemical camouflage of the skin to not be smelled by sharks, jet-propulsion and swimming away, blasting of ink to confuse the predator and which also contains a substance to dull olfactory senses, leaving the water and escaping over a rock, attaching to the sharks back and riding the shark in a save place, sacrificing an arm in order to get out of the predators grasp.</p>", "taxon_text_6_9109": "<p>Sexes are separate and other than by the hectocotylised third right arm males can be distinguished from females by enlarged suckers on the second and third arm pairs, although in the South African specimens the difference is not as profound as in the true European <i>O. vulgaris. </i>Enlarged suckers may be displayed to other males and signal dominance.</p><p>Mating occurs all year round and involves little physical contact. Male and female octopus are careful of each other, especially when animals are of different sizes. The male extends its third right hectocotylised arm towards the female. This is rarely seen as it is often done through gaps in rocks or through crevices to avoid physical proximity. Once contact is made the male ejects a spermatophore sperm package into the groove of its arm and uses its siphon to pump it through the groove towards the tip. The arm is extended directly into the female's mantle, and a specialised erectile structure, the ligula, places the spermatophore directly inside the female\u2019s reproductive tract. Females can copulate multiple times with either the same or different males and store the spermatophore for several months until spawning.</p><p>It is thought that two spawning peaks occur, one at the end of winter (August/September) and one at the end of Summer (February/March). Females excavate dens in shallow waters that have overhanging rock ceilings, towards which they attach the clutches of eggs. Egg numbers are estimated to vary between 42 0000 to 790&nbsp;000. Dens are barricaded against the outside and hence difficult to find. Females stop feeding and don\u2019t leave their den to constantly guard, protect and care for their eggs until they hatch, after which the female dies. Depending on water temperature it takes 1-2 months for the paralava hatch.</p><p>Octopus paralarva are a few millimetres in size, translucent and swim into the open ocean after hatching, where they develop for about 45 days before settling to a benthic lifestyle, undergoing ecological and morphological transformation.

These chromatophores can also create pulsating, psychedelic colour patterns that help with countershading and disorient predators.</p><p>Inking is another defensive tactic. A thick, dark ink is released in bursts to create a pseudomorph \u2013 an ink cloud that resembles the shape of the animal. The ink hangs in the water, slowly changing shape and confusing predators, giving the argonaut time to escape. Large females have even been observed \u2018towing\u2019 <i>Cyanea</i> spp. jellyfish, possibly to use them as protection against predators.</p><p>This species was originally described from specimens collected in South Africa. Like other paper nautiluses, it is vulnerable to global climate change. Ocean acidification could either dissolve the calcium carbonate egg case or interfere with its formation altogether.</p>", "taxon_text_5_9126": "<p>Argonauts likely feed on a variety of pelagic organisms, including molluscs, shrimp, plankton, and small fish. They have been observed feeding on euphausiids (krill), and large aggregations may coincide with the presence of euphausiid schools. In captivity, females have also accepted dead prawns and fish.</p><p>They can use their distal webs to detect food at the ocean surface \u2013 when a prey item touches the expanded web, an arm quickly extends from the shell to grab it. This passive \u2018bump and grab\u2019 feeding method contrasts with active hunting. In active predation, once prey is detected, the tentacles catch and draw it toward the mouth, where venom from the salivary gland is injected. In the case of shelled prey, the salivary papilla is likely used to drill through the shell before delivering the venomous cocktail.</p><p>Argonauts are potential prey for many larger ocean predators and rely entirely on their camouflage to avoid detection.</p>", "taxon_text_6_9127": "<p>Argonauts have a highly evolved and fascinating reproductive biology. The sexes are strongly dimorphic: females are large and have webbed arms that form a brood chamber where they lay their eggs. Males, in contrast, are dwarfs and do not build such structures, living freely in the open ocean. Males possess a highly specialised third left arm, called the hectocotylus, which makes up a large portion of their body.</p><p>Although mating behaviour remains unknown, it is thought that when a male encounters a female, he transfers spermatophores into his specialised arm. This arm then detaches from his body, crawls autonomously into the female\u2019s mantle cavity, and finds her reproductive tract, where it deposits a sperm packet. The detached arm may remain inside the female for weeks, with spermatophores stored until she is ready to spawn.</p><p>Like all octopuses, females spawn their eggs in festoons (long strands of eggs), which pass through the oviduct and are fertilised by stored sperm cells. The female then attaches the eggs inside the coiled brood chamber, which provides structure and protection. Eggs are laid repeatedly, and up to five different developmental stages can be present at the same time. This results in paralarvae hatching continuously, increasing the chances that some offspring encounter suitable ocean conditions for survival.</p><p>The eggs spawned within the shell are very small (less than 2 mm long and 1 mm wide) and are produced in large numbers, with up to 180,000 eggs per individual. In the final stages of development, the embryos form numerous chromatophores, which they can contract to appear white and transparent or expand to show bright orange. Development to hatching is estimated to take about seven days. The resulting paralarvae are tiny versions of the adults and immediately adopt a planktonic open ocean lifestyle.</p><p>Females are believed to be capable of reproducing multiple times during their lifespan, while males are thought to die after mating, having sacrificed their hectocotylised arm.</p>", "taxon_text_7_9128": "<p>Although each argonaut\u2019s shell is individually variable, the three species found locally can be easily distinguished by their shell features and size.
