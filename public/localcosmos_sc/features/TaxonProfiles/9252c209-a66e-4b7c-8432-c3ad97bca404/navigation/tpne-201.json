    "description": "<p>Argonauts are a group of pelagic octopuses that inhabit the world’s temperate and tropical oceans. Four species are recognised globally of which three can be found in South Africa. Argonauts evolved from benthic octopuses to spend their entire life cycle in oceanic waters. They are best recognised by the delicate, beautiful white shells of females referred to as ‘paper nautiluses’, which regularly wash ashore especially during prevailing southeasterly summer winds. These are no true molluscan shells but are built as brood chambers for the eggs by the females using specialised, shell-secreting webs at the tip of the dorsal arms. Females can leave, repair and rebuild their shells at any time. Argonauts display extreme sexual size dimorphisms as males are diminutive and shell-less, and even more rare to find. Three of the four globally recognised species occur in South African waters: <i>Argonauta argo</i>, <i>A. hians</i>, and <i>A. nodosus</i>. In recent years, the latter washed ashore most frequently, even if the literature says it is the rarest of the three species.</p>",
