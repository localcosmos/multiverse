They are laterally compressed, with a single continuous dorsal fin and forked tail. Most species are diurnal and form shoals on shallow temperate reefs (although some are territorial and/or extend to 450 m depth). Many species change sex as they grow.</p><p>This relatively elongate but plump, smaller species is often seen forming dense shoals on shallow reefs and is fairly easily recognized by the silvery ground colour and 8–10 prominent yellow horizontal stripes running the length of the body. The fins are also tinged with yellow and there is a small black spot at the base of the pectoral fin.</p>",
