The everted proboscis ends in a pair of strong jaws and has characteristic comb like rows of small teeth, after which the common name is derived.</p><p>Its habit of secreting a transparent tube that binds together fronds of seaweed is also fairly characteristic and a useful clue to identification.</p>",

These individuals then leave their tubes on specific nights and swim up into the water column, where they perform a nuptial dance, their bodies burst to release the sperm and eggs and then they die.</p><p>After fertilization the eggs develop into planktonic larvae which do not feed but subsist on maternal yolk provided in the eggs. Larval life is short at about 3 days (in the European species) and the worms then settle as tiny 3-segmented forms that progressively develop new segments at their posterior ends.</p>",
