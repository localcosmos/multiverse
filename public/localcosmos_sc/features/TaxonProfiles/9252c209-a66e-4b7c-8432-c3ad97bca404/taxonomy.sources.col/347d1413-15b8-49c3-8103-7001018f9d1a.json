In live animals the mantle, which itself can be dramatically coloured and textured, completely covers the shell, so it can be difficult to match images of live animals with those of dead shells (indeed some species are known only from dead shells). Although often thought of as a primarily tropical group, a wide diversity of endemic cowries are found in the cooler waters off South Africa.</p><p>The shell of this species is globular, with a pale pink ground-colour overlaid with chestnut-brown patches. The underside is off-white with an unusually wide and slightly curved aperture. The outer lip has19-25 fine, widely-spaced light orange or brown teeth, while the inner lip has 19-22 weak denticles which only extend onto the lower surface at the extreme anterior end of the aperture, The live animal is fairly distinctive as the mantle is pale pink with numerous black spots and has many large finger-like papillae, which lack the spotted pattern. The broad siphon has a lobed margin, and the tentacles are yellow to pink.</p>",
