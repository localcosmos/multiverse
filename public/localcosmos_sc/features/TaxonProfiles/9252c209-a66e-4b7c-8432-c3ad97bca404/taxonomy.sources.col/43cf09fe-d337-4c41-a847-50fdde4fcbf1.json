            "shortText": "<p>Gobies are a diverse family of small, bottom-dwelling fish, most with a broad, depressed head, dorsal fin separated into anterior spiny and posterior soft-rayed sections and pelvic fins united to form a cup-like disc on which the fish rests when sitting on the bottom. The eyes are usually placed close together on top of the head. Some tropical species are brightly coloured, but temperate ones are generally pale and well camouflaged.</p><p>Although there are over 100 species in southern Africa, few extend to the Western Cape. This species is much smaller than other similar gobies in the region and is relatively slender. It is characterized by the fact that the gill openings on the two sides are united beneath the throat by a free fold of skin. Colour mottled grey with pale underside.</p>",

The Banded goby <i>C. caffer </i>has about 10 marked vertical bars along the sides the body and the Prison goby <i>C. gilchristi&nbsp;</i> similar but thinner bars and these are arranged in about 8 pairs.
