Antennae similar in length, but second pair densely hairy in males, which also have dense fringes of hairs along ventral margins of side plates. Claws moderate in size, first pair slightly smaller than the second. First two pairs of legs contain cloud-like silk glands. Last pair of abdominal appendages (uropod 3) with characteristic short, paddle-like branches, the outer branch armed with two large, terminal, hook-like spines.&nbsp;</p><p>Best recognized by its habit of constructing cylindrical nests woven from algal debris and incorporated into seagrass or algal beds in estuaries and on sheltered sandbanks.</p>",
