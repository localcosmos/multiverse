The third and fourth pairs of legs are entirely missing and only gills are present on those body segments. Legs 5-7 are powerful, extended laterally and end in large grasping claws for clinging to the skin of their cetacean hosts.&nbsp;</p><p>Several species occur in the region, each distinguished by body shape, form of the gills, and by associated with particular cetacean hosts. This species has an unusually slender, almost parallel-sided body and the gills each consist of a single short ‘sausage’ only about as long as two body segments. It is one of three species of whale louse associated with Southern right whales.</p>",
