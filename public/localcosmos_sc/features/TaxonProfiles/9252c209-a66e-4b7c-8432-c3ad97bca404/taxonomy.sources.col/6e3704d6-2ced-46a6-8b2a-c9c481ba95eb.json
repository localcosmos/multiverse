They have elongated, generally smooth, conical shells that are mostly plain peach-coloured. The foot is extremely large with two tiny ‘tails’ at the posterior end and the operculum is much smaller than the aperture. The siphonal canal is very short and there is often a large shiny area (callus) extending from the inner lip of the aperture.</p><p>Some regional species are hard to distinguish from one another and this species is easily confused with several others, so named images on websites etc. cannot be relied upon as being accurately identified. The key identification features are the long, pointed spire, lack of steps and of crimping between whorls and that the operculum has a strongly-serrated margin. Shell colour is also often characteristically tinged with purple, often with a purple line around the aperture. The surface of the shell is often coated in green algae.</p>",

Lives shallowly buried in the sand low on the beach, or in the shallow subtidal, smelling the water using the siphon to detect carrion washed up on the beach. When prey is detected, numerous plough shells quickly emerge from the sand, roll over onto their backs and raise the enlarged foot like a sail in order to catch an incoming wave and surf up the shore towards the prey item. They then roll over and, using a rowing action of the sides of the enlarged foot, crawl up the odour trail towards the food item, leaving a characteristic track in the sand as they do.</p><p>Feeding is very rapid and involves plunging the proboscis into the prey, commonly a bluebottle or a jellyfish, rasping the food with the radula and sucking the pieces up the large tubular proboscis. As soon as the sand becomes too dry, the plough shells abandon the prey and re-bury themselves until another waves wets the sand.</p>",
