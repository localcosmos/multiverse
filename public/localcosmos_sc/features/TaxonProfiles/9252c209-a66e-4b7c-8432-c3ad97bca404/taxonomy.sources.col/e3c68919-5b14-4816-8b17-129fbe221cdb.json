Namibian colonies have declined considerably over past 50 years due to decline in fish stocks, but South African population have increased over same period.&nbsp;Adults leave colonies to forage 1-4 hours after sunrise and return1-2 hours before sunset, but some may spend several days away, roosting at sea, sometimes in large rafts. In calm weather need to run to get airborne, and when returning to colony typically make one or more circuits, calling loudly, before landing.&nbsp;</p><p>Feeding range extends across continental shelf and birds from the various South African colonies tend to have fairly discreet feeding ranges. In winter large numbers also follow sardine run along KwaZulu-Natal coast. Often feed in large groups on shoals of pelagic fish, often in company of other predatory seabirds, seals, dolphins, whales and gamefish in ‘feeding-frenzies’. Usually plunge dive from height of 5-20 m, but also dive from surface.&nbsp; Shallow dives use momentum alone, birds bobbing back to surface passively due to their positive bouyancy, but can dive to at least 20 m by underwater swimming and flapping.</p>",

Incubated by both parents, using their highly vascularised food webs to wrap around and warm the eggs. &nbsp;Incubation period 43-44 days.
