The outer lip is never toothed or pleated, as in other more-or less-conical groups, such as olive shells and marginellas. Although cones are most diverse in tropical seas, a few species extend into the cooler waters of the Western Cape.</p><p>This species has a moderately extended spire with slight steps between the whorls. The cleaned shell (as depicted in most guides) is generally off-white with chocolate flame-like markings, but in life this is covered with a yellow-brown semi-transparent outer layer (periostracum). Body dark brown with white eyestalks. There are several regional colour variants.</p>",
