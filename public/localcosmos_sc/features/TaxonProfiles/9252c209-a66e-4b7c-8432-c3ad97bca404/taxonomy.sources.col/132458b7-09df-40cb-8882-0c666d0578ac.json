Indeed where they are abundant most algal clumps on this level on the shore are in fact growing on the shells of the limpets themselves – the only surfaces they cannot graze!</p><p>Growth is very rapid relative to other limpets, a length of 56 mm being attained in the first year of life and 70 mm by the end of the second year. Few individuals survive beyond 3 years in age.</p><p>The commensal flatworn <i>Notocomplana erythrotaenia</i> is commonly found under the shell between the foot and the mantle.</p>",
