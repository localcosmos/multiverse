Mating takes place at sea and females return to the same beach where they were born to nest, in October to January in South Africa. Females drag themselves up the beach at night and excavate holes above the high-water mark using their hind flippers. Clutches of about 100 eggs are laid and the hole then filled in. The same female then returns to lay another batch of eggs at about 10-day intervals, laying up to 1000 eggs in a season. Eggs hatch after about 60–70 days and at a size of about 6 cm and 45 g. As in all turtles, the sex ratio of offspring is determined by incubation temperature, eggs incubated at temperatures above about 29.4°C developing mostly into females and those below this temperature into males. Newly hatched young emerge mainly at night to avoid predation, and may be heavily predated by crabs, seabirds and fish especially if they emerge by day.</p>",
