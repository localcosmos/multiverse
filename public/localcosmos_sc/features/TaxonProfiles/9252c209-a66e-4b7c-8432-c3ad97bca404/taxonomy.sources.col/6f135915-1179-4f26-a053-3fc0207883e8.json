There are only about 50 described species worldwide and only 4 in South Africa.</p><p>This species can be white, orange or green and is elongate and tubular with the gonads showing as double rows of paler bulges along the column.

It is upright and has pad-like adhesive structures at the base of the arms beneath the tentacles.
