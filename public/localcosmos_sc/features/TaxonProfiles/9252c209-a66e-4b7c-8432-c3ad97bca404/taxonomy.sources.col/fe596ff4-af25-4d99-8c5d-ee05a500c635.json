They are best thought of as colonies formed from a few types of collaborating cells. Size and colony shape is often very variable within a species and accurate identification relies largely on examining the microscopic spicules that make up the skeleton. All are filter feeders, drawing in water through small opening on the body surface, removing fine particles and ejecting the waste water from one or more usually larger openings called oscula.</p><p>This is a massive, dark-grey sponge that tends to form a ‘wall’ with vertical sides separated from a flat upper surface by a distinct ridge that is marked by a row of fine spicules that protrude from the surface. The texture is firm and the upper surface bears small oscula. The inner flesh is light orange.</p>",
