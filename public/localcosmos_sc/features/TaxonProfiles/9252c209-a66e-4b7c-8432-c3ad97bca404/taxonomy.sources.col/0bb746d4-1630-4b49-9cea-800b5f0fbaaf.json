            "shortText": "<p>Klipfishes of the family Clinidae are small, elongate, laterally-compressed, bottom-dwelling fishes with a single dorsal fin stretching head to tail. The pelvic fin is inserted in front of the pectoral fin and consists of just 2-3 elongate rays (and one concealed spine) and the tail is rounded. All species are viviparous and the males have a prominent intromittent organ just behind the anus. The group is particularly common and diverse in intertidal and shallow water systems along the southern and western coasts of South Africa and together these make up the continent’s largest group of endemic fish species.</p><p>This small, slender and only recently described species has a dorsal fin with 29-33 spines and 1-3 rays. The first 3 spines are raised into a pronounced dorsal crest and there is a distinct notch after the third spine – the membrane between the third and fourth spine being transparent (making it look even deeper than it is). The head is fairly pointed and there are no cirri above the eyes.</p><p>Colour is fairly variable and mottled, but there are 6 vertical brown, pink or red bars on sides of the body and 6 others on the dorsal surface and extending onto the dorsal fin that are offset from those on the sides. The most distinctive features are the bright electric blue dots behind the eyes and also along the base of the dorsal fine and sides of the body, after which the species in named. The translucent pectoral fins usually have yellow tips.</p>",
