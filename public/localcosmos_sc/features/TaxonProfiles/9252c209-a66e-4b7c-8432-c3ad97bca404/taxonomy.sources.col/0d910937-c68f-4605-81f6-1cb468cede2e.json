Usually there are alternating larger and smaller tubercles in each row.</p><p>The pleotelson is also tuberculate, but otherwise very different in the two sexes. In males it is greatly enlarged and terminates in an unusual keyhole-shaped notch that has a raised margin. In females the margins of the pleoteson are folded downwards, so that when viewed from above it has a narrowly-rounded raised tip. In both sexes the uropods are unusual in that the inner branch, which bears a row of dorsal tubercles, is forked at its tip, whereas the outer branch is smooth and ends in an outwardly-curved and pointed tip.</p>",

The species do, however, still differ in the size and form of the dorsal tubercles, which are larger and button-shaped in <i>S. polytylotos</i> and smaller and more conical in <i>S. microtylotos</i>. The distinction between these species is thus retained, although this should be confirmed by genetic analysis, as there is a good deal of variation on dorsal ornamentation between individuals.</p><p>Note that males of <i>Parisocladus</i> also show this unusual keyhole-shaped opening in the pleotelson, the function of which remains unknown. <i>Parisocladus </i>lack dorsal tubercles though.</p>",
