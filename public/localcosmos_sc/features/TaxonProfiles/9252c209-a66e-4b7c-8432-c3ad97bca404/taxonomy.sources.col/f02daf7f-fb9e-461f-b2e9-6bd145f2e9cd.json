Many tropical species are very brightly coloured, but those found in the temperate parts of South Africa tend to be more cryptic.</p><p>This species is very flat and almost completely transparent (hence the common name). The body is fairly elongate and more or less parallel-sided with ruffled edges (not oval, as in some similar species). Some specimens are almost completely transparent, but other bear pale blotches. The central ruffled pharynx is the only opaque region and shows up as a white central band. There are no tentacles, but a distinct pair of fairly-large black eyes.</p>",
