Species level taxonomy remains confused, as most species were described from dead shells, (which are fairly featureless in this group) and more modern records show great variations in the colours of the live animals, these possibly representing separate species.</p><p>The transparent shell of this species is characterised by having almost no spire, but rather a flattened posterior end, while the anterior end lacks a siphonal notch, instead having a fairly widely--rounded opening. The inner lip bears 2 strong oblique pleats and 2 much smaller ridges (‘lirae’), while the outer lip is thickened, but bears no teeth or ridges.</p><p>Live specimens collected from Table Bay (and depicted below) are distinctively coloured and have a bright orange siphon, transparent foot with white central blotch and the internal organs showing though the shell as yellow with 2 broad black crossbars.</p>",
