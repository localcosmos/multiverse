Unlike anemones though, they are colonial and colony members remain united by a basal sheet of tissue. Most species carpet tropical shores, this one is thus unusual both in it temperate distribution and because it lives in sponges.</p><p>Colonies infiltrate sponges on shallow reefs, with the individual polyps emerging through the surface of the sponge. The delicate polyps are about 5 mm tall, white to pale yellow, not covered in sand and have fairly long slender tentacles (for a zoanthid). Often seen in the Tree sponge <i>Echinoclathria</i>, which may host so many zoanthid polyps that infected sponges are sometimes mistaken for seafans.</p>",
