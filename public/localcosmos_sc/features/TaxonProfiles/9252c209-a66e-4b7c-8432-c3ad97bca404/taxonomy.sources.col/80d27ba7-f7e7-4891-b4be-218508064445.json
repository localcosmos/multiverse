Usually seen patrolling areas that might offer suitable food, such as vicinity of seal colonies. Capable of impressive speeds and can capture fast-swimming prey such as mako sharks, dolphins and seals, sometimes breaching clear of the water when attacking seals from below.</p><p>Undertakes long migratory movements to take advantage of seasonal food resources, one tagged individual having been recorded moving between South Africa and Australia! In False Bay large numbers of individuals move into the area in winter to feed on seal pups, which begin to forage away from the colony at that time. The same individuals return year after year to take advantage of this seasonal food source, moving off up the east coast in summer. Pattern has been interrupted by the presence of orcas that specialized on hunting and killing sharks causing White sharks to avoid the South Coast and move further east.</p><p>All members of this family are essentially warm-blooded, maintaining a body temperature above that of the surrounding ambient water, and this accounts for their highly active, predatory habits and makes them among the fastest-swimming of all fish.</p><p>Females mature at a length of about 400-500 cm and age 12-14 years, while males mature at 350-400 cm at age 9-10 years. Life expectancy contentious with some studies giving this as about 27 years and others estimating longevity of as long as 70 years.</p><p>The species is protected in South Africa and the killing of Great white sharks has been prohibited since 1991. As top predators the total population size is very limited and the total population in South Africa is estimated to be only about 500 individuals. Individuals can be photographically recognised by the profiles and markings on their dorsal fins.</p>",
