            "shortText": "<p>Klipfishes of the family Clinidae are small, elongate, laterally-compressed, bottom-dwelling fishes with a single dorsal fin stretching head to tail. The pelvic fin is inserted in front of the pectoral fin and consists of just 2–3 elongate rays (and one concealed spine) and the tail is rounded. All species are viviparous and the males have a prominent intromittent organ just behind the anus. The group is particularly common and diverse in intertidal and shallow water systems along the southern and western coasts of South Africa and together these make up the continent’s largest group of endemic fish species.</p><p>This species is one of the most distinctive of all klipfishes and is easily recognized by the form of the dorsal fin, in which the first 8 spines are separated from one another by deep notches in the membrane and are each tipped by a bunch of prominent filaments. The body is stocky with large eyes and there is a conspicuous cirrus above each eye, composed of a flat base leading to a hand of long, thin filaments. The dorsal fin has 31–34 spines and 5–7 rays.</p><p>Colour variable pale brown to red with several (usually 4) darker vertical bars.</p>",
