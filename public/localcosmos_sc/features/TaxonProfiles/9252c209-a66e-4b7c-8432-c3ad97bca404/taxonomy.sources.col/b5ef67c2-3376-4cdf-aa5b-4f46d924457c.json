            "shortText": "<p>An extremely common species that is restricted to the intertidal and most abundant high on the shore, extending well up into the barnacle zone. Maintains a home scar, where the profile of the shell exactly matches that of the rock. Undertakes feeding excursions both at high tide and when the weather is cool, rainy or misty, and is very effective at maintaining the rock surfaces free of algae. This can be demonstrated by placing exclusion cages, or painting closed circles or squares of anti-fouling paint onto the rock, which the limpets will not cross. Within a few weeks excluded areas become completely coated with algae!</p><p>Much of the habitat originally occupied by this species has become monopolized by the invasive Mediterranean mussel <i>Mytilus galloprovincialis</i> and there was initially concern that the limpets would be severely impacted, but research has demonstrated that they in fact not only survive but attain a higher density and reproductive output in mussel beds than on un-invaded rocks. They do this by living on the shell valves of individual mussels, which cumulatively provide a much larger surface area than the smooth rock. Although growth is much slower on these restricted territories, the limpets still reach sexual maturity and breed there. Thus mussel beds support a larger number of smaller ‘bonsai’ limpets than were present before invasive mussels established and altered the upper shore.</p><p>Growth rates are highly variable between sites, generally being faster on the west coast. The size at one year of age varies from about 20-40 mm and longevity has been estimated at about 6-7 years.</p>",
