However, the shells enclose the animal dorsally and ventrally, rather than laterally, as in bivalves. The ventral shell is usually larger and is cupped, while the dorsal one is flatter. A stalk or pedicel emerging from the rear of the shell attaches the animal to the substratum. Internally the dominant organ is a large feathery, horse-shoe shaped filter-feeding organ (the lophophore), which is supported by a delicate internal skeleton.</p><p>This species has a delicate oval and transparent-white shell marked with only very faint ribs. The internal skeleton is in the form of a closed circle.</p>",
