            "shortText": "<p>Klipfishes of the family Clinidae are small, elongate, laterally-compressed, bottom-dwelling fishes with a single dorsal fin stretching head to tail. The pelvic fin is inserted in front of the pectoral fin and consists of just 2-3 elongate rays (and one concealed spine) and the tail is rounded. All species are viviparous and the males have a prominent intromittent organ just behind the anus. The group is particularly common and diverse in intertidal and shallow water systems along the southern and western coasts of South Africa and together these make up the continent’s largest group of endemic fish species.</p><p>This is a relatively large, robust and heavy-bodied species with a rounded head that is depressed behind the eyes, a wide mouth with thick lips and large eyes. There is a prominent brush-like cirri above each eye, made up of a flat stalk bearing a fringe of filaments. The dorsal fin has 30-34 spines and 5-6 rays, and has a slight notch after the third spine, but is not raised into and anterior crest. The pectoral fins are large and fleshy.</p><p>The eyes have a characteristic radiating pattern of alternating light and dark brown ‘spokes’. The rest of the body is mottled in light and dark brown, yellow and cream, arranges to form a series of seven darker brown vertical bars. There is often a large orange patch above the pectoral fins and behind the eyes.</p>",
