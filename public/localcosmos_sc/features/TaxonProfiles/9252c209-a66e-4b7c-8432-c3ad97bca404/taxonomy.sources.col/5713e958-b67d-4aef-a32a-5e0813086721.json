This food taken are protein rich ones, such as mussels and limpets, as well as the eggs of catsharks, which are often laid attached to seaweeds in intertidal pools and represent a particularly rich protein source. Marine foods only represent about 10% of the total diet even in these troops.</p>",

Females have an estrous cycle of an average of 36 days and the stage of the cycle is indicated by the colour of the skin around the callosities and mating is usually with the dominant male. Gestation period is 6 months and a single offspring is born at any time of the year. The mother carries the young initially on her underside, but later on her back. Larger young may sit jockey-style on the mother’s back just in front of the tail. Lactation normally lasts at least 8 months.</p>",
