External colour variable, but usually black or brown with paler bluish or white flames, in juveniles with darker spiral bands of white and brown bars. Mature specimens often strongly eroded and pitted with polychaete and burrowing barnacle holes. Internal colour pearly white. Umbilicus closed, operculum round, very thick and calcareous, external surface granular and with a groove that spirals towards a distinctive central pit.</p><p>There are two subspecies, the Cape <i>T. cidaris cidaris</i> (described above) and the eastern <i>T. cidaris natalensis</i> that has 6-11 well defined spiral ridges on each whorl of the shell and no central pit in the operculum. It seems very likely that these should be recognized as separate species, but we are not aware of genetic or morphological research that is needed to support (or negate) this change.</p>",

Commonly preyed upon by a variety of predators including rock lobsters, octopus, African Black Oystercatchers and Kelp gulls. The latter drop large individuals onto flat rocks or ‘anvils’ to break the tough shell and access the meat. Are sometimes also collected for human consumption but should be surprisingly, little is known about growth rate, longevity of other biological characteristics.</p>",
