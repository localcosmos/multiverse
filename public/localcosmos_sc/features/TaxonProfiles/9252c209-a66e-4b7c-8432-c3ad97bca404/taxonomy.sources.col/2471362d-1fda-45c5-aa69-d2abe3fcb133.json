The prawn pumps water through its burrow, where it filters out food particles using its hairy mouthparts. Susceptible to human activities and are frequently taken as bait for recreational fishing. Mudprawns are also at risk to trampling from beachgoers as their burrows collapses and sediment becomes compacted, making burrowing increasingly more difficult. Research has shown that bait-harvesting of these animals have far greater effects on the population than just the number of animals removed. Mudprawns are not as tolerant as sandprawns to diverse conditions and unlike them are completely absent from closed estuaries in which salinity levels are low.</p>",

Known to produce small, but numerous eggs (often several 1000 per brood per female). Larvae are released into the water column where they have a planktonic larval phase before they settle in the sediment, creating their burrows.</p>",
