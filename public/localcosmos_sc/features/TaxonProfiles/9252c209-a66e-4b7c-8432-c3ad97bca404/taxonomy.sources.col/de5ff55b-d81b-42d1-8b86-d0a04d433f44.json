Behind this the posterior segments each have large, branched, white parapodia that serve as gills.</p>",

As water passes through this net fine organic particles are trapped by it. Sections of the mucous bag are then cut off and passed forwards to the mouth to be eaten!</p><p>Apart from this amazing feeding mechanism, <i>Chaetopterus</i> worms also frequently host commensal species within their tubes. On a global basis these include a number of scaleworm species, many species of crab and even a nudibranch that is reputed to feed on the mucous net. This species is also well known for exhibiting strong bioluminescence. The function of this is unknown, since the worms do not posses light-detecting organs and spend their entire lives buried inside their tubes!</p>",
