The third and fourth pairs of legs are entirely missing and only gills are present on those body segments. Legs 5-7 are powerful, extended laterally and end in large grasping claws for clinging to the skin of their cetacean hosts.</p><p>Several species occur in the region, each distinguished largely by the form of the gills, as well as by associated with particular hosts. In this species the gills each consist of a single elongate ‘sausage’ with a short crescent-shaped accessory gill at its base. This is also the only whale louse association with Humpback whales.</p>",
