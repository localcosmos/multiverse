Easily spread by seed or from cuttings and is widely used to stabilise slopes, or as ground cover, such as along freeways.</p><p>An ecologically significant species that provides shelter and habitat to numerous species including snails, reptiles and many insects. The flowers are pollinated by a variety of bees and beetles and flowers and fruits are eaten by rodents, antelope, porcupines and baboons. The leaves are also eaten by tortoises.</p><p>The edible fruit are widely collected to make a popular tart jam.
