            "shortText": "<p>Klipfishes of the family Clinidae are smallish, elongate, laterally-compressed, bottom-dwelling fishes with a single dorsal fin stretching head to tail. The pelvic fin is inserted in front of the pectoral fin and consists of just 2–3 elongate rays (and one concealed spine) and the tail is rounded. All species are viviparous and the males have a prominent intromittent organ just behind the anus. The group is particularly common and diverse in intertidal and shallow water systems along the southern and western coasts of South Africa and together these make up the continent’s largest group of endemic fish species.</p><p><i>Clinus musaicus </i>appears to be a range-restricted form within the broader<i> C. superciliosus </i>complex and has a dorsal fin with 38-40 spines and 7-8 rays, the first 3 spines forming a low crest with a shallow notch between the 3rd and 4th spines. The orbital cirrus is a flat stalk with several short, simple branches.</p><p>The species is defined largely by colour and more boldly marked than most other clinids. Ground colour is very variable, including pink, grey, brown or black, but the upper half of the body usually has a series of bold lozenge-shaped darker marks with another offset series around the midline, while the lower part of the body is generally white, often broken into reticulated pattern by darker lines (hence illusion to ‘mosiac’ ), or speckled with small white spots. Fin membranes usually transparent and can end in pastel colours.</p>",
