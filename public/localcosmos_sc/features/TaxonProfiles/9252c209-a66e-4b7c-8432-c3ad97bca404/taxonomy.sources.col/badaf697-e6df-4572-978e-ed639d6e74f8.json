They are laterally compressed, with a single continuous dorsal fin and forked tail. Most species are diurnal and form shoals on shallow temperate reefs (although some larger species are territorial and/or extend to 450 m depth). Many species change sex as they grow.</p><p>The Steentjie is one of the smaller species in the group and has a forward-projecting snout, unusually large eye, and jaws armed with 4–6 rows of slender, pointed incisors. The body is silvery-blue with several faint horizontal golden stripes and often a blue band between the eyes. Breeding males change colour to become dark anteriorly, with 3–5 large bluish-black vertical patches posteriorly, some becoming almost black. Breeding females are paler with white marks on the flanks.</p>",

The eggs are laid as a yellow mass and cover most of the area of the nest, where they are guarded by the male against both predators and other males.
