They are best thought of as colonies formed from a few types of collaborating cells. Size and colony shape is often very variable within a species and accurate identification relies largely on examining the microscopic spicules that make up the skeleton. All are filter feeders, drawing in water through small openings on the body surface, removing fine particles and ejecting the waste water from one or more usually larger openings called oscula.</p><p>This species is fairly easily identified by its characteristic tree-like shape, emerging from a small disc-like attachment to expand into broad upright, flattened branches or wide fans. The surface is soft, but slightly hairy and lacks prominent oscula and the colour is consistently bright-orange to red.</p>",
