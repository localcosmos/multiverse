Populations can achieve massive densities of up to 1700 individuals per square meter. Associated with the paint-like pink coralline algae <i>Chaimberlainium</i> spp. Larger individuals also maintain narrow gardens of fast-growing, fine red algae, which they defend and on which they feed. Juveniles start life on the backs of adults and initially feed on coralline algae, before establishing their own gardens (sometimes on the shells of larger individuals). When an adult dies it is quickly replaced by a juvenile, which moves down off an adjacent adult and occupies its territory, hence maintaining a consistent population density.</p><p>Growth is initially fairly rapid with shell length of about 25-40 mm being attained in the first five years of life (depending on site), but growth then slows to about 1 mm per year, suggesting that large individuals may attain ages of at least 15-25 years, far older that any other regional species of limpet.</p>",
