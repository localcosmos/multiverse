They are laterally compressed with a single continuous dorsal fin and forked tail. Most species are diurnal and form schools on shallow temperate reefs, although some are territorial and/or extend to 450 m depth. Many species change sex as they grow.</p><p>Adults of this species are deep-bodied with a steep, projecting forehead (slightly concave in adults) and fairly large mouth. Head and body orange, becoming paler on underside. Blue line between the eyes and small dark marks along rear of operculum and at base of pectoral fin. A larger and distinctive black patch at rear of dorsal fin. Juveniles pink with a faint horizontal band along side, two darker blotches beneath dorsal fin and distinct spot at rear of dorsal fin (as in adults).</p>",
