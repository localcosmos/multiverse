Due to the restricted opening to the bell, contractions result in a powerful jet current, which allows box jellies to swim much faster than most other jellyfish. The tentacles can be greatly extended when feeding, but can be rapidly contracted when disturbed, or to bring prey back to the mouth. The South African species is venomous and can inflict a painful sting, but is not nearly as dangerous as the well-known related Australian species, which can be fatal.</p><p>Known to be eaten by sunfish <i>Mola mola</i>.</p>",
