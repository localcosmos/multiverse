Most species carpet tropical shores, this one is thus unusual both in its temperate distribution and because it occurs in overhangs and under boulders, rather than in the open.</p><p>Colonies are generally small and formed of a few dozen individuals, each of which is orange to pink, has a column covered on course sand and is topped by about 30 relatively long (for a zoanthid) tentacles.</p>",
