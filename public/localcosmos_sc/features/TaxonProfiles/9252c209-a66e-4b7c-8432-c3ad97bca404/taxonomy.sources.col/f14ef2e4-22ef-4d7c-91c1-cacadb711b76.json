Marketable size is reached after about 33 months and oysters are harvested both commercially and recreationally. In KwaZulu-Natal the coastline is divided into 10 management zones with commercial fishing allowed in two years out of five in each zones. Recreational collection is allowed in the years preceding commercial harvesting in each zone. Annual commercial catches in the early 2000s were about 200 000 oysters per year. On the Cape coast effort is controlled by licencing pickers and by a short closed season over the peak holiday season. Annual commercial catch in this region over the early 2000s was around 400 000 oysters per year, but this is based on catch returns and excludes the take by subsistence and recreational fishers, which may be considerable.</p>",
