They are laterally compressed with a single continuous dorsal fin and forked tail. Most species are diurnal and form school on shallow temperate reefs (although some are territorial and/or extend to 450 m depth). Many species change sex as they grow.</p><p>This relatively small species is best characterized by its unusually large eye, its silvery-bronze colour and the fact that the rear edge of the operculum and the lateral line are black. Small juveniles are bright red.</p>",
