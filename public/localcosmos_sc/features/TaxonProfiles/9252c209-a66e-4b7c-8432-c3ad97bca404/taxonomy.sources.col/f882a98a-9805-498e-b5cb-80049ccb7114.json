The most common form is greyish-white covered in black dots that are each encircled by an opaque white ring. However, in some specimens the mantle is yellow or pink and the black markings are elongate and worm-like or stippled.</p>",

Also, these species are largely defined by features of the shell, which is usually concealed by the mantle in live images. To complicate matters further, mantle colour can be highly variable within species!
