            "shortText": "<p>Pycnogonids are bizarre animals sometimes referred to as ‘sea-spiders’ since both groups have 4 pairs of usually elongate, slender legs. However, they are not closely-related to true spiders, so we prefer the term pycnogonid. The body consists of a head with a tubular proboscis, usually a pair of grasping chelicerae, a pair of sensory palps and a pair of ovigerous legs. The latter are unique to this group and used both for grooming and, in the males, to carry the eggs. Behind the head is an elongate trunk consisting of usually four segments, each of which bears large lateral processes to which the legs are attached. At the end of the trunk is a small, usually conical abdomen.</p><p>This species is a particularly strange and distinctive one. It has an unusually stout body and legs and is bright pink or orange in colour. The first body segment is broadly triangular and inflated into three anterior knobs, while the head and tapering proboscis are downwardly flexed and invisible from above. The entire body and legs are covered with tiny conical spines. The legs are unusual in that they end in a single simple claw (most pycnogonids have a pair of auxilliary claws on either side of the main terminal claw).&nbsp;</p>",

As the female releases her eggs these are fertilised by the male, who then gathers them up and carries them in a spherical mass attached to his ovigerous legs until they hatch.</p>",
