Like many other members in the porcelain crab family (Porcellanidae) these crabs will readily let go of their chelae that breaks off at a predetermined place as a diversion when they are in danger to fool predators (much like a gecko would let go of its tail). This intentional breaking is also the origin of the name porcelain crab for the family. The pincers can be regrown at a later stage if the escape act was successful. This species is occasionally caught as bycatch on deeper demersal trawls, where they can be commonly along the south coast.</p>",
