Identification to species level is difficult, as there are about 50 regional species and colour patterns are both extremely variable within species and can quickly change in the same individual to match the background.</p><p>This species was long known as <i>S. bleekeri, </i>but recent research has demonstrated that to be an invalid name and the correct name should be <i>S. turbynei</i>. The species is best recognized by the distinctive short, black, rounded pectoral fin on the upper side, after which the common name is derived. The bases of the dorsal and anal fins are joined to the tail fin by a membrane and the colour is usually brown with dark spots.</p>",
