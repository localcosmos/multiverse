Posterior end of the cuttlebone has a sharp spine that sticks out of the middle of this gap. Has large, almost bulbous eyes and short arms with four rows of suckers. Tentacles long with short, slightly curved clubs that have greatly enlarged medial suckers. Cuttlebone elongated and oval, tapering towards the downwardly curved end that bears a sharp, upwardly pointed spine.&nbsp;</p><p>Colour variable, from white over pink to a deeper brown red. Skin of entire animal with a slight iridescent shine, but noticeable strongly iridescent areas below the eyes and beneath the the fins and on the belly. Can also display broad stripe along the base of the posterior half of the fins during mating, as well as creating a large, white circle on the frontal eye area.</p>",
