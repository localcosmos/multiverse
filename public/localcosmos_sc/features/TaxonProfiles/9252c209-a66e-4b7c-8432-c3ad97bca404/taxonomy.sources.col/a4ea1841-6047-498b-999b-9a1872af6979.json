They are best thought of as colonies formed from a few types of collaborating cells. Size and colony shape is often very variable within a species and accurate identification relies largely on examining the microscopic spicules that make up the skeleton. All are filter feeders, drawing in water through small opening on the body surface, removing fine particles and ejecting the waste water from one or more larger openings called oscula.</p><p>This species can be identified by its characteristic spherical shape, orange to red colour and slightly knobbly or ‘warty’ surface, which is marked with a number of round oscula, each with a raided margin. The underside has root like processes to attach the sponge firmly to the substratum.</p>",
