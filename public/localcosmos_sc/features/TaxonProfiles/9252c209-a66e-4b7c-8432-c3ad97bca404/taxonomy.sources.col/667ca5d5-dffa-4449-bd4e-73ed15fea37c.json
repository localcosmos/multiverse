            "shortText": "<p>Klipfishes of the family Clinidae are small, elongate, laterally-compressed, bottom-dwelling fishes with a single dorsal fin stretching head to tail. The pelvic fin is inserted in front of the pectoral fin and consists of just 2–3 elongate rays (and one concealed spine) and the tail is rounded. All species are viviparous and the males have a prominent intromittent organ just behind the anus. The group is particularly common and diverse in intertidal and shallow water systems along the southern and western coasts of South Africa and together these make up the continent’s largest group of endemic fish species.</p><p>This small, fairly-elongated species has a pointed head and small mouth, while the dorsal fin is not elevated anteriorly and has 36–38 spines and 2–3 rays. The colour pattern is distinctive, comprising a pale cream ground-colour with three irregular dark-purple/brown dorsal saddles and paler purplish patches and scribbles between. The gravel habitat is also a useful aid to identification, as most related species occur on reefs.</p>",
