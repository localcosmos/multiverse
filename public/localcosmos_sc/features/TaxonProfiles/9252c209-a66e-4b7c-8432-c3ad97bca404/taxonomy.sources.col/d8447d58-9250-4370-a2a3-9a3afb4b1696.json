They have elongated, generally smooth, conical shells that are mostly plain and peach-coloured. The foot is extremely large with two tiny ‘tails’ at the posterior end and the operculum is much smaller than the aperture. The siphonal canal is very short and there is often a large shiny area (callus) extending from the inner lip of the aperture.</p><p>This is one of the more distinctive species, as it is very heavy and squat with an exceptionally large aperture, a short, smooth spire (shorter than length of aperture) and a large callus on the underside. The operculum is tiny, oval and un-serrated.</p>",
