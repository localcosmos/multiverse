            "shortText": "<p>Klipfishes of the family Clinidae are small, elongate, laterally-compressed, bottom-dwelling fishes with a single dorsal fin stretching head to tail. The pelvic fin is inserted in front of the pectoral fin and consists of just 2–3 elongate rays (and one concealed spine) and the tail is rounded. All species are viviparous and the males have a prominent intromittent organ just behind the anus. The group is particularly common and diverse in intertidal and shallow water systems along the southern and western coasts of South Africa and together these make up the continent’s largest group of endemic fish species.</p><p>This relatively small, slender and compressed species has an even dorsal fin of 35–41 spines and 2–3 rays, lacking either an anterior crest or notch (although the second spine may be slightly longer than the others). The cirri above the eyes are elongate and spoon-shaped, with lateral branches. Colour highly variable and often very attractive, commonly with broken brown or red vertical bars, and often with two large, dark spots on dorsal fin. There is generally a distinctive yellowish, dark-edged flare across the cheek and the eyes have a characteristic radiating pattern of alternating orange and green ‘spokes’.</p>",
