Now a dominant species on rocky shores all along the west coast, but less abundant on the south coast. Physiological research suggests that the species is unlikely to expand further east into the warmer waters of KwaZulu-Natal. More tolerant of arial exposure than other regional mussel species, thus extending mussel beds higher up into the intertidal than before.</p><p>Certainly the most significant marine invasive species in the region to date and has multiple ecological and economic impacts. Many invaded shores were previously dominated by large grazing limpets, which kept the rocks fairly open and clear. These sites are now carpeted by dense mussel beds and thus support a much larger biomass and a greater diversity of species, especially small forms which now find shelter between the mussels. Some limpet species have been displaced, while others have managed to survive among the mussels by becoming dwarfed and living and feeding on their curved shell valves. Food availability for predators has also increased and this has been to the advantage of species such as the Black African Oystercatcher, which now has access to more food, which is also available for more hours in the day. Also used for human consumption and a significant culture industry based on this species is centred in Saldanha Bay. Surprisingly the mussels settle and thrive in the permanently-submerged culture ropes, but do not appear to occur in significant numbers on other submerged habits, but remain mostly restricted to the intertidal.</p>",

Food particles filtered from the water are transported by cilia to the ventral edge of the gill and then forward to the mouth at the anterior (pointed) end, where they are sorted by the labial palps and lighter particles ingested. Inedible particles are rejected by the palps and ejected as ‘pseudo faeces’ which has not passed thought the digestive tract.&nbsp;</p>",

Spawning is usually synchronised via hormones released with the sperm and eggs and after spawning ‘spent’ individuals are thin and flaccid. Spawning is triggered by temperature changes and in temperate areas spawning occurs predictably in spring and autumn. However, in South Africa sea temperatures show much more seasonal stability and spawning tends to be more irregular and is probably triggered by short-term upwelling events. The numbers of eggs produced is enormous, running to the millions per mussel and hence billions per square meter of mussel bed! Larval development takes about 30 days and juvenile mussels (spat) sometimes settle in densities of hundreds of thousands per square meter.</p><p>This species has and equal sex ratio (48% male, 52% female) and usually breeds twice a year, once in summer and once in winter.</p>",
