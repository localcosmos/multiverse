Dorsal fin large, upright and sexually dimorphic, being smaller and curved backwards in females and much larger (up to 2m) and more triangular in males.</p><p>Colour pattern diagnostic – black dorsally with white lower jaw and belly. Another small white patch behind the eye, a grey or white saddle dorsal behind dorsal fin and another white patch on underside of tail.</p>",

Most often seen on offshore fishing grounds, but can be found close to the coast where they are always a thrill to see, although unpredictable in their distribution and habits. Elsewhere can form groups (pods) of up to 200 animals, but in South Africa groups are much smaller, usually of only 3–4 individuals. Fast swimming, reaching up to 30 km/h and have excellent senses of vision, hearing and echolocation. Produce whistling sounds for communication and clicking ones for echolocation. May undertake significant migrations, but the movement patterns of South African populations not well understood. Have a complex social structure and can form groups of several types, some stable and descended from a ‘matriarch’ and other groups looser and more transient.</p>",

A pair of two males in False Bay is well known for attacking Great white sharks and has had a devastating impact on the population and the associated shark spotting industry! Despite their obvious ability to consume prey as large or larger than humans, no human fatalities have been noted in the wild, although some have been attributed to captive orcas.</p>",

Males mature at about 15, but typically do not start reproducing until about 21 and are shorter-lived than females, reaching an age of about 60. Gestation varies from 15–18 months and young are born at about 180 kg and a length of 2.4 m. Females normally produce one calf about every five years. Although reproduction is seasonal in colder regions, in warmer waters young may be born at any time of year. The young are fed by the mother for at least one and up to two years.</p>",
