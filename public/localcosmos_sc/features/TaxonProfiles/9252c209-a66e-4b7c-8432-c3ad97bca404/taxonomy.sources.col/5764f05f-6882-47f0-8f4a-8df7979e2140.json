Often seen mixed with other cormorants. Flight rather heavy and laboured, usually low over water. Forages close inshore, but can dive to at least 28 m, deeper dives initiated by jumping out of water. Dives each about 30-60 secs and occur in bouts of about one hour, with rests between. Sometimes spread wings after foraging to warm body and aid digestion.</p>",
