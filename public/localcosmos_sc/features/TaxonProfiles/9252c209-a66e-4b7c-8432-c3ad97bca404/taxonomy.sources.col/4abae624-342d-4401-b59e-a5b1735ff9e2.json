Very common on flat subtidal reefs and sand-inundated areas in the intertidal. Tend to be quite weakly attached and often wash up in vast numbers after storms. Juveniles often settle along the margins of the shells of adults and later migrate down between them, attaching to the rocks and ultimately displacing the adults by forcing them upwards and replacing them. Growth is rapid and can reach 70 mm after the first year when permanently submerged, but is slower in intertidal populations, which have reduced opportunity to feed, which of course they can only do when submerged.</p>",

The water is then filtered thought the enlarged sieve-like gills and ejected though a dorsal, smooth-edged exhalent siphon. Food particles filtered from the water are transported by cilia to the ventral edge of the gill and then forward to the mouth at the anterior (pointed) end, where they are sorted by the labial palps and lighter particles ingested. Inedible particles are rejected by the palps and ejected as ‘pseudofaeces’ which has not passed thought the digestive tract. Not surprisingly, given its sandy habitat, this species is particularly adept at separating sand from food and can feed even in very turbid water conditions.</p>",

Spawning is usually synchronised via hormones released with the sperm and eggs and after spawning ‘spent’ individuals are thin and flaccid. Spawning is triggered by temperature changes and in temperate areas spawning occurs predictably in spring and autumn. However, in South Africa sea temperatures show much more seasonal stability and spawning tends to be more irregular and is probably triggered by short-term upwelling events. The numbers of eggs produced is enormous, running to the millions per mussel and hence billions per square meter of mussel bed! Larval development takes about 30 days and juvenile mussels (spat) sometimes settle in densities of hundreds of thousands per square meter.</p><p>In this species about 60 % of adults are males and 40 % females. There are normally two protracted breeding seasons a year, but the timing of these is quite variable</p>",

Thus large <i>Mytilus </i>can stand upright on a flat surface, whereas <i>Choromytilus </i>always fall over onto their sides.
