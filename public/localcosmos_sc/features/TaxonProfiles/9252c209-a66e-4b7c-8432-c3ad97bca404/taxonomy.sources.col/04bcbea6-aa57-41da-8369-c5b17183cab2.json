            "shortText": "<p>Klipfishes of the family Clinidae are small, elongate, laterally-compressed, bottom-dwelling fishes with a single dorsal fin stretching head to tail. The pelvic fin is inserted in front of the pectoral fin and consists of just 2–3 elongate rays (and one concealed spine) and the tail is rounded. All species are viviparous and the males have a prominent intromittent organ just behind the anus. The group is particularly common and diverse in intertidal and shallow water systems along the southern and western coasts of South Africa and together these make up the continent’s largest group of endemic fish species.</p><p>This unusually large species has a very stocky, compressed body and blunt, rounded head bearing a large mouth and thin lips with vertical corrugations. The dorsal fin has 32–34 spines and 9–14 rays, the first 3 spines being raised into a slight crest, followed by a shallow notch before the 4th spine. Colour mottled brown or reddish with broken darker bars that extend onto the dorsal and pectoral fins. Usually cheek bars radiating form below eyes. Eyes with a circle of radiating lines around the iris.</p>",
