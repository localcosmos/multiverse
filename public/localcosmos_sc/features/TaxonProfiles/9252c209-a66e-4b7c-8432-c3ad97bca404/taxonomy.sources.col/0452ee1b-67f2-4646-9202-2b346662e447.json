Smaller colonies are usually circular with concentrically arranged rings of zooecia, but larger ones can become irregular and buckled or folded.</p><p>The individual zooids are enclosed in flat, regularly-arranged, coffin-shaped cases (zooecia) and when examined microscopically the surface is finely pitted. The oval opening has a raised edge and proximal notch and is closed by a dark, hinged operculum. When extended, the lophophores are conical and pale orange, each with about 20 tentacles.</p>",
