Unusual in that the sphincter is weak and so the tentacles cannot be completely withdrawn, so is permanently ‘open’. Well known for its territorial behaviour, individuals inflating their vesicles and using them to attack and sometimes kill unrelated individuals. Where several similarly-coloured individuals occur in close proximity these are thus almost certainly genetically-identical and derived from fission of a founding individual.</p><p>The venom of the stinging cells is particularly potent and captive animals in the marine aquarium have been observed to capture juvenile catsharks on several occasions. The catsharks, which settles on an expanded anemone, were instantly paralysed and offered no resistance as they were slowly dragged into the mouth by the tentacles and swallowed. If one touches these anemones with a finger the stinging cells fire and the tentacles stick into the skin, but the venom is unable to penetrate the dead epidermis, so the sting is not painful (in case of allergic reaction, it is unrecommended trying this though!).</p>",
