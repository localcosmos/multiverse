These are <i>C. superciliosus </i>itself, which remains valid and indeed is the most common or at least most conspicuous of the ‘daughter’ species, and the new (or resurrected) <i>C. arborescens, C. exasperatus, C. ornatus, C. musaicus </i>and<i> C. spatulatus</i>. It is thus important to note that any biological information (on diet, reproduction, etc) published prior to 2012 refers to the whole group and not just the form now known as <i>C. superciliosus.</i>&nbsp;</p>",

            "shortText": "<p>Klipfishes of the family Clinidae are smallish, elongate, laterally-compressed, bottom-dwelling fishes with a single dorsal fin stretching head to tail. The pelvic fin is inserted in front of the pectoral fin and consists of just 2–3 elongate rays (and one concealed spine) and the tail is rounded. All species are viviparous and the males have a prominent intromittent organ just behind the anus. The group is particularly common and diverse in intertidal and shallow water systems along the southern and western coasts of South Africa and together these make up the continent’s largest group of endemic fish species.</p><p><i>Clinus superciliosus</i> is one of the larger species in the genus and is the most common clinid at many intertidal and shallow water sites. The head is large and the dorsal fin has 32–38 spines and 8–9 rays, the first three spines being strongly elevated into a conspicuous triangular crest, which is most pronounced in adult males, where it can be 2.5 times the height of the rest of the fin. There is a deep notch after the third spine and the crest spines lack conspicuous cirri but have a single filament at tip. The cirrus above the eye has a short stalk with a flattened end bearing short branches – these being longer and more filamentous in males.</p><p>Body colour is extremely variable and can be plain or mottled green, grey, red or brown, but there are usually about 6 vertical half-bars on the dorsal side of the body and often radiating lines from the eyes across the cheeks. Often a dark comma-shaped spot is present on the operculum and a black spot at base of second dorsal spine.</p>",
