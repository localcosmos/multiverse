The rostrum is broad with 4 deeply incised teeth on the sides.</p><p>The overall brick-red-orange colouration and blue (occasionally white) spots is characteristic. The pleon (hind body) is a lighter orange, often mottled, while the tail is white. Eyes generally green, while pincers and walking legs are orange with some mottling at the bases.</p>",
