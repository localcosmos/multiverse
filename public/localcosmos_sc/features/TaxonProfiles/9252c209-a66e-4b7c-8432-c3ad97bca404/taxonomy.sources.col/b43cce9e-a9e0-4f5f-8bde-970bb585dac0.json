The populations also differ slightly in mean size (west coast form slightly larger) and shape of the baleen plates. The offshore west coast population also bear numerous scars from the bites of cookie-cutter sharks, these being rare in the south coast inshore population.</p><p>Bryde’s whales are usually found singly or in small, loose groups that assemble where prey is abundant. They are lunge feeders, swimming upwards though shoals of fish with the mouth and throat massively distended. They are not deep divers and usually undertake a series of short dives, each lasting about one minute, often followed by a longer dive of about five minutes.</p><p>Bryde’s whales were often not distinguished from Sei whales by early whalers, making fishing statistics unreliable, however, it is thought that they were less impacted than most other species by commercial whaling. The South African population was estimated as 582 individuals in 1983.</p>",
