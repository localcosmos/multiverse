They are laterally compressed, with a single continuous dorsal fin and forked tail. Most species are diurnal and form shoals on shallow temperate reefs, although some larger species are territorial and/or extend to 450 m depth. Many species change sex as they grow.</p><p>This species has a deep, silvery body and the blunt, rounded head typical of all stumpnose (and after which the common name is derived). It can be distinguished from other regional stumpnose by the single golden horizontal bar running along the side of adults from head to tail. In juveniles there are 5–6 fainter bars. There is also a small back spot at the base of the pectoral fin.</p>",
