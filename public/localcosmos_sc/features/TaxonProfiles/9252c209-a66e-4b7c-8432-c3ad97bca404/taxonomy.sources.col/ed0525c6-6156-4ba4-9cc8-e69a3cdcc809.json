They are best thought of as colonies formed from a few types of collaborating cells. Size and colony shape is often very variable within a species and accurate identification relies largely on examining the microscopic spicules that make up the skeleton. All are filter feeders, drawing in water through small opening on the body surface, removing fine particles and ejecting the waste water from one or more usually larger openings called oscula.</p><p>This distinctive golden-yellow boring species lives largely buried within limestone rocks from which the flat-topped, circular inhalant siphons emerge. These are fairly flush with the substratum and the aperture is covered with a characteristic mesh-like lattice to keep out course particles. The larger oscula tend to have taller columns and have a round, open aperture.</p>",
