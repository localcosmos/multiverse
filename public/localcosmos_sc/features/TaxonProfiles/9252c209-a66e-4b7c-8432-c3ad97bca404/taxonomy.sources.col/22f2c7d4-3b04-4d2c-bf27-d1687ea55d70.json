In live animals the mantle, which itself can be dramatically coloured and textured, completely covers the shell, so it can be difficult to match images of live animals with those of dead shells (indeed some species are known only from dead shells). Although often thought of as a primarily tropical group, a wide diversity of endemic cowries are found in the cooler waters off South Africa.</p><p>The shell of this species if fairly easily identified, especially by the 15-20 dark brown ridges (‘teeth’) that run across the ventral surface and after which it is named. The dorsal surface of the shell is densely patterned with fused brown spots and dashes and the margins are usually purple (all colours fade in dead museum specimens and many guides depict such old, faded shells). The mantle of live animals is very variable in colour (as in many other local species), but is typically brown with black spots and often bears small finger-like papillae. The short siphon has a white band at its top and the tentacles are usually yellow to apricot.</p>",
