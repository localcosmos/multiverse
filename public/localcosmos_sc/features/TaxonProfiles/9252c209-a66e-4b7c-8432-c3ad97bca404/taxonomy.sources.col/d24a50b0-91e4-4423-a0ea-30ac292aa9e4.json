            "shortText": "<p>Klipfishes of the family Clinidae are small, elongate, laterally-compressed, bottom-dwelling fishes with a single dorsal fin stretching head to tail. The pelvic fin is inserted in front of the pectoral fin and consists of just 2–3 elongate rays (and one concealed spine) and the tail is rounded. All species are viviparous and the males have a prominent intromittent organ just behind the anus. The group is particularly common and diverse in intertidal and shallow water systems along the southern and western coasts of South Africa and together these make up the continent’s largest group of endemic fish species.</p><p>This relatively small, slender and stocky species has a large head and wide mouth. The dorsal fin has 30–34 spines, the first few with 2–3 small cirri at their tips; followed by 5–7 rays. The dorsal fin is relatively even in height with a slightly raised section over the posterior rays, but with no anterior crest or notch. Body colour variable, but usually pale green or yellow with darker head and a few wide vertical dark bars along the body (less obvious in larger individuals). Indistinct ocellus on shoulder and body often with scattering of numerous small white of yellow spots. Tips of pectoral fins reddish.</p>",
