Chelae inner side of upper margin with fringe of shaggy hair, outer surface of wrist and hand with granules. Second leg with horned ridge on end of the fourth joint, creating a stridulating mechanism (used for communication) when rubbed against its chelae (especially in older males). Dactyl (last segment) of fifth leg flattened, oval-shaped, used as a ‘paddle’ for swimming.</p>",

Move fast over the sand and can quickly dig themselves into the sand with a characteristic and dynamic backwards pumping movement. With just the eyes sticking out they are safely hidden from predators, and ready to attack bypassing prey. Mostly active at night.</p><p>Like all crustaceans, frequently moult as they grow, and this is done in the safety of being buried in the sand. Fresh moults that wash up are therefore often fragmented as parts of the fragile shells remain stuck in the sand. Studies have found larger individuals occur shallower (&lt;20 m), while juveniles tend to occur in deeper waters, suggesting settlement of larva occurs deeper.</p><p>Biomass of these crabs have been estimated to around 1 crab per square meter of beach (based on a study in Gqeberha, formerly Port Elizabeth), and the species is commercially important in Chile and Argentina, though only taken as bycatch using beach-seine nets. In some instances mass mortalities occurred due to larvae of the alien invasive mussel <i>Mytilus galloprovincialis </i>settling on the eyestalks and mouthparts (as these are virtually the only hard substratum where mussel larvae can settle on sandy habitats), severely reducing the crabs ability to function, and this has led to mortalities of 2000-2400 crabs per kilometre of shore.</p>",

Short spawning period present in January, with a longer one in May, where female release the eggs to the underside of their body and carry them until they hatch. Studies have found females to be extremely fecund, carrying between 76000-490000 eggs.
