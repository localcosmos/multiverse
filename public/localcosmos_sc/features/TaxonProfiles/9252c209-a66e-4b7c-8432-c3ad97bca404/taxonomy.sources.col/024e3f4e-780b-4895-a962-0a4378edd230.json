The burrows appear to begin as small semicircular structures each inhabited by one of two adult amphipods and their young, but over time numerous burrows may develop and merge so that the entire distal margin of the head becomes irregularly eroded back. Heavily infected kelps are easily recognized by eye, even from the shore. Up to a third of adult kelps may host amphipods, older individuals with larger heads being most frequently infected. Heavily infected kelps may house more than 100 individuals (most of them juveniles), the mean number of amphipods per infected host being 20.</p><p>It is remarkable that this species was only recently discovered, given that is it both relatively large and causes conspicuous damage, and that a great deal of earlier research done on the fauna of kelp beds in the region failed to note its presence. The species is named after Dr Roberta Griffiths (wife of the describer, and author of this species account) in recognition of their joint research on kelp beds.&nbsp;</p>",
