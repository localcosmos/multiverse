They are laterally compressed, with a single continuous dorsal fin and forked tail. Most species are diurnal and form schools on shallow temperate reefs, but some larger species are territorial and/or extend to 450 m depth. Many species change sex as they grow.</p><p>This species is very distinctive as an adult, due to its very large size, black body (with white belly), thick lips, stout conical teeth and unusual bulbous, fleshy nose. Large adults are seldom seen in the wild though and juveniles, which lack the prominent nose, are dark (initially greenish or yellowish) brown with 2 broad black vertical areas and irregular white patches.</p>",
