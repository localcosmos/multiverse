The eye from the lower, unpigmented, side of the body has migrated to the upper side, which is typically cryptically patterned. Identification to species level is difficult, as there are about 50 regional species and colour patterns are both extremely variable within species and can quickly change in the same individual to match the background.</p><p>This species completely lacks a pectoral fin and has a distinctively hooked snout that curves over the mouth. The dorsal and anal fins are separated from the tail fin. Colour variable, but usually grayish-brown with distinctive small dark specks; sometimes there are also three vague larger dark spots along the lateral line.</p>",
