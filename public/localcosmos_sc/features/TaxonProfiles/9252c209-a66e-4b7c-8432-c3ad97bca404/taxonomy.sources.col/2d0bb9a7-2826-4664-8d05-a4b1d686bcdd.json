            "shortText": "<p>Seabreams of the family Sparidae are particularly well represented in South Africa and include many important recreational and commercial fisheries species. They are laterally compressed with a single continuous dorsal fin and forked tail. Most species are diurnal and form schools on shallow temperate reefs, but some are territorial and/or extend to 450 m depth. Many species change sex as they grow and this change may be in either direction – having larger females resulting in production of more eggs, but having larger more powerful males allowing them to better defend their territories!</p><p>This iconic fish is one of the most attractive in the region and is sought after by underwater photographers, but also by anglers and spearfishers! It is easily identified by its bright red body colour with a large triangular white patch behind the head and vertical white bar below the dorsal fin. There is a blue line between the eyes. Juveniles are initially pale reddish-brown with a dark brown horizontal line extending forward from the tail and they develop their red colour from about 5 cm length.</p>",

Change sex from female to male, females reaching maturity at a length of 17–20 cm and then changing to male at a length of 30-33 cm.
