            "shortText": "<p>Seabreams of the family Sparidae are particularly well represented in South Africa and include many important recreational and commercial fisheries species. They are laterally compressed with a single continuous dorsal fin and forked tail. Most species are diurnal and form schools on shallow temperate reefs (although some are territorial and/or extend to 450 m depth). Many species change sex as they grow.</p><p>Adult males of this species are easily recognized by the conspicuous hump that develops on the forehead, after which the common name is derived. Large adults of this overexploited species, which anyway inhabit deeper waters, are now mainly seen in captivity though, while juveniles are more commonly seen on shallower reefs. Younger fish have distinct reddish vertical bars of varying widths, the bulbous forehead starting to become evident at a length of about 25 cm. In larger individuals the barring becomes less distinct and ‘messy’ and the body develops numerous black spots.</p>",
