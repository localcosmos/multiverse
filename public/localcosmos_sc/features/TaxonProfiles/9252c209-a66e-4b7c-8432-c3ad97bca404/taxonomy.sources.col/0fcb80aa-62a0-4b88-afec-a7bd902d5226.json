They are best thought of as colonies formed from a few types of collaborating cells. Size and colony shape is often very variable within a species and accurate identification relies largely on examining the microscopic spicules that make up the skeleton. All are filter feeders, drawing in water through small opening on the body surface, removing fine particles and ejecting the waste water from one or more larger openings called oscula.</p><p>Thinly-encrusting, bright-orange sponge that spreads across the undersides of boulders and the surfaces of rocky reefs. Surface smooth and hard. Oscula not prominent, but surrounded by a radiating network of grooves, after which the common name is derived.</p>",
