However, as they are not closely-related to true spiders, we prefer the term pycnogonids. The body consists of a head with a tubular proboscis, usually a pair of grasping chelicerae, a pair of sensory palps and a pair of ovigerous legs. The latter are unique to this group and used both for grooming, as well as used by males to carry the eggs. Behind the head is an elongate trunk consisting of approximately four segments, each of which bears large lateral processes to which the legs are attached. At the end of the trunk is a small, usually conical, abdomen.</p><p>This species is easily distinguished from other local species by its bright red colour. It is relatively large and has long spindly legs. The head possesses both palps; chelifers and ovigerous legs are present in both sexes.</p>",
