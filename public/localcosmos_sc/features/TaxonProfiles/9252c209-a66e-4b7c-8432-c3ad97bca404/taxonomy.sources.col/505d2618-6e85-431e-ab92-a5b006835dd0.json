They are best thought of as colonies formed from a few types of collaborating cells. Size and colony shape is often very variable within a species and accurate identification relies largely on examining the microscopic spicules that make up the skeleton. All are filter feeders, drawing in water through small opening on the body surface, removing fine particles and ejecting the waste water from one or more larger openings called oscula.</p><p>This species forms a soft, compressible bright purple to pinkish sheet on rocky substrata. Numerous tubular, sometimes coalescent, turret-like branches of varying lengths extend upwards from the surface, each with a rounded end bearing a circular osculum.</p>",
