The pelvic fin is inserted in front of the pectoral fin and consists of just 2–3 elongate rays (and one concealed spine) and the tail is rounded. All species are viviparous and the males have a prominent intromittent organ just behind the anus. The group is particularly common and diverse in intertidal and shallow water systems along the southern and western coasts of South Africa and together these make up the continent’s largest group of endemic fish species.</p><p>This small, elongate and eel-like species has a narrow, pointed head marked with a conspicuous white dorsal stripe running forward from the dorsal fin (and after which it is named). The dorsal fin is low and even, with no anterior crest. Colour variable, but usually plain greenish brown to almost black.</p>",
