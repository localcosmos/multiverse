            "shortText": "<p>Klipfishes of the family Clinidae are small, elongate, laterally-compressed, bottom-dwelling fishes with a single dorsal fin stretching head to tail. The pelvic fin is inserted in front of the pectoral fin and consists of just 2–3 elongate rays (and one concealed spine) and the tail is rounded. All species are viviparous and the males have a prominent intromittent organ just behind the anus. The group is particularly common and diverse in intertidal and shallow water systems along the southern and western coasts of South Africa and together these make up the continent’s largest group of endemic fish species.</p><p>This small, slender klipfish has a flattened head and eyes set well-forward and high on top of the head. Dorsal fin low, with 33–37 spines and 7–11 rays, anterior spines not raised into a crest. Pelvic fin unusual in that it has 3 not 2 uncurled rays that are joined by a membrane along most of their length (giving ‘web-footed’ appearance and hence common name ‘platana’ klipfish). Colour pattern distinctive and off-white with about 8 transverse pink to purple bars, each with a darker outline, sides of body with bright white spots.</p>",
