Also particularly vulnerable to human induced disturbances including coastal pollution, habitat alteration, capture in shark nets, vessel strikes, noise etc. Calves tend to exhibit high rates of morality and tissues of stranded specimens often show high levels of chemical pollution. The South African population is estimated at only about 500 individuals, so the species is of conservation concern.</p>",
