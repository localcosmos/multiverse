They are best thought of as colonies formed from a few types of collaborating cells. Size and colony shape is often very variable within a species and accurate identification relies largely on examining the microscopic spicules that make up the skeleton. All are filter feeders, drawing in water through small opening on the body surface, removing fine particles and ejecting the waste water from one or more larger openings called oscula.</p><p>This species forms thin, delicate encrustations that frequently overgrow and cover beds of mussels, or other sedentary invertebrates. The sheet-like semi-transparent body bears numerous small low turrets each ending with a round opening surrounded by a white ring. Colour blue-grey to dark blue and purple with white rings around oscula.</p>",
