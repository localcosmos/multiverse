Most marine species belong to the Order Polyclada, which are generally fairly-large (10-40 mm) and broad and have a many-branched gut. Triclads, also known as planarians, are smaller (&lt;10 mm) with a longer, narrower body shape and a 3-branched gut. The group is relatively uncommon in marine habitats, although diverse in freshwater and in damp terrestrial habitats.</p><p>This species has an elongate skittle-shaped body tapering towards a pointed head. The tip of the head is black and the rest of the body decorated with longitudinal brown and white bands, with two pronounced transverse white bands, one immediately behind the head and the other midway along the body. There is a pair of black eyes on the head, but these can be difficult to distinguish against the striped body pattern.</p>",
