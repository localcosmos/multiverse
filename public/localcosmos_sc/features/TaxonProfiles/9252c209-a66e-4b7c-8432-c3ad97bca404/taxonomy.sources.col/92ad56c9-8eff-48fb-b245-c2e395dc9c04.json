Colour usually red.</p><p>Animal much larger than shell, which simply perches on its back. Head is not projected into an elongate narrow snout (as in the similar <i>Dentrofissurella</i>), but is rounded. Numerous large frilly branching projections around margin of shell. A pair of long red tentacles extend forward. Body colour generally yellow to orange or red.</p>",

Indeed we believe this to be the first identified image of a live specimen to be published. Hopefully now that the live animal is known and can be recognized, more information about the distribution and biology of this species can be gathered.</p><p>Could also be confused with the smaller keyhole limpet <i>Fissurella mutabilis</i>, but in that species the shell is flat and not saddle-shaped and almost completely covers the animal.</p>",
