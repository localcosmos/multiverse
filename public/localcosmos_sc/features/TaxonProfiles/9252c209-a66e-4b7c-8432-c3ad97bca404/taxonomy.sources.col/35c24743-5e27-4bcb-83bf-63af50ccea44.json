The amphipods are facultative parasites when adult (in other words they also live outside of jellyfish), but the relationship is obligate in juveniles. There is a tendency for the amphipods to move to the gonads of the host as it becomes larger, the reason being that the gonad tissue provides higher carbon and protein concentrations than other tissues.</p><p>&nbsp;In the North Sea the relationship is strongly seasonal with jellyfish being much more heavily parasitised in late summer and autumn, when they are larger and sexually mature. In Namibia, infection rates were low (4%) in summer, but much higher (38%) in winter, suggesting that the jellyfish may breed at that time, which correlates with their generally larger sizes in winter.</p>",
