Incubation 28-30 days by female only, with male often guarding territory from vantage point nearby. Chick precocial and leave nest within hours of hatching, sometimes by jumping from elevated nests. Chicks guided to water by adults, sometimes crossing busy roads! Fledging period variable at 55-84 days. Adults defend chicks by herding them to water when threatened, making alarm calls, feining injury and by attacking intruders.</p>",
