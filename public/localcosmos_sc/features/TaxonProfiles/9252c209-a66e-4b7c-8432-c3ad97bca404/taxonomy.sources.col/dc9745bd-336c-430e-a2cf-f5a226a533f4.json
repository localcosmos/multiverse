Narrow fins run along entire lateral margins and are well separated at the tail. Arms short, with four rows of suckers. Tentacle clubs elongate and narrow with numerous small, equal-sized suckers. Cuttlebone broadly oval with a pointed knob at posterior end.</p><p>Colour variable and individuals can change their appearance within seconds: red-purple, orange-brown or yellow, or even completely white are possible background colours. A typical colouration is mottled pinkish-brown dorsally with yellow to orange fins, a pinkish-white underside, and sometimes dark longitudinal stripes along the arms. Sometimes threatens with large and deeply black eye-spots on either side of the second half of the mantle.</p>",

Although adults are sometimes still observed around their clutches of eggs, there is no proven parental care.</p><p>As the young develop the ink layer peels off, making it possible for the unhatched animals to observe their environment from the safety of the egg, before they hatch as perfectly developed tiny cuttlefish. Development probably takes several months and certainly depends on water temperature. The young of this species are never seen in shallow waters either because they have a highly cryptic lifestyle and hide in rock crevices or algae, or they spend the first months in deeper waters.</p>",

            "shortText": "<p>There has been considerable confusion in local and online field guides around the correct image identifications of local cuttlefish species, due to the fact that colouration, shape and posture are highly variable and that cephalopods can change their appearance within seconds. After the cuttlebone, which lies inside the animal and which is hence not useful to identify live specimens, one of the main identification characters are the tentacle clubs. However, these are the animals most important weapon and tool for catching prey, and are hence held safely and invisible in between the arms.</p><p>Treating our species identification with some caution, the Simonâ€™s Town cuttlefish is the main and most common large cuttlefish in the shallow water kelp forest. The second common species, the Tuberculate cuttlefish <i>Sepia tuberculata</i>, is much smaller and fairly easily distinguished by the smaller size, the rough tuberculate surface, and perhaps most easily by the unusual behaviour of physically attaching to the substrate using the large glandular patch on the underside. Especially small specimens of <i>S. simoniana</i> can look similar to <i>S. tuberculata </i>but are able to show larger eye-spots as threat display (see images of juvenile).</p><p><i>Sepia simoniana </i>is very similar in size and form to the slightly larger Patchwork cuttlefish <i>S. vermiculata</i>, the only species in the Western Cape that is known to enter estuaries and which is common in the Knysna Lagoon, as well as reported from Langebaan. In that species however the mantle is broader, the surface smoother, and the lateral fins broader. Colour displays are different in that it can show zebra-like, transverse patterns on the mantle, white spots on the base of the lateral fins and a narrow white line on the fin margin, which all seem to be characteristic. The cuttlebone of <i>S. simoniana </i>has a blunt knob on the posterior end rather than a sharp spine as in <i>S. vermiculata.</i></p><p>Another species, identified in this guide with caution as the Southern cuttlefish, <i>Decorisepia australis, </i>has a similar colour tone and general appearance to <i>S. simoniana</i>. In the field it can be identified by being marginally smaller than <i>S. simoniana </i>and by having slightly different body proportions that include shorter arms, a larger eye, and a slightly more elongated mantle. At first glance the colour pattern seem almost identical, however, <i>D. australis</i> has a deeper red colouration including a pinkish red belly. The best live identification character appears to be the presence of iridescent skin beneath the eye and underneath the front of the fin.</p><p>A further species of similar size to <i>S. simoniana</i> and <i>S. vermiculata</i> that is so far not covered in this guide and potentially hidden in images presented, <i>Spathidosepion papillatum</i>, occurs in the same waters and has enlarged suckers on the tentacle club.</p>",
