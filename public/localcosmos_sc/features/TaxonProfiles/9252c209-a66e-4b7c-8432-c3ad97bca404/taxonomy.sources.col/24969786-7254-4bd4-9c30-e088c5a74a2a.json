Cellulose may be a good choice for a protective coasting, as few animals have enzymes capable of digesting this material! In this species further protection is afforded by incorporation large pieces of shell or rock into the test matrix and concealing the body within narrow crevices.</p>",

When they are ready to settle they attach themselves to the substratum with adhesive papillae on the head and resorb the tail and notochord, effectively rotating the body 180 degrees so that the ‘mouth’ or inhalant siphon, now points upwards.</p>",
