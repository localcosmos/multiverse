            "shortText": "<p>Klipfishes of the family Clinidae are small, elongate, laterally-compressed, bottom-dwelling fishes with a single dorsal fin stretching head to tail. The pelvic fin is inserted in front of the pectoral fin and consists of just 2-3 elongate rays (and one concealed spine) and the tail is rounded. All species are viviparous and the males have a prominent intromittent organ just behind the anus. The group is particularly common and diverse in intertidal and shallow water systems along the southern and western coasts of South Africa and together these make up the continent’s largest group of endemic fish species.</p><p>This slender, laterally compressed species has an elongate head, a small mouth and a long, slender peduncle to the small tail. The dorsal fin has 29-32 spines and 7-8 rays. The first three spines are raised into a distinct crest, but there is no notch in the membrane jointing the third and fourth spines.</p><p>The colour seems to be variable, perhaps depending on both size and the algal species on which the specimen is living. &nbsp;Typically, the body is green with longitudinal darker green, yellow or iridescent stripes. The specimen shown here also has a prominent yellow nose-stipe.</p>",
