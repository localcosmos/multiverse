Live for less than two years, yet some uncertainty remains whether mortality occurs immediately post-spawning.</p>",

Squid migrate to shallow (&lt;60 m) spawning grounds during austral summer months in sexually segregated groups. Temperature change is thought to trigger spawning as it occurs synchronously with increased upwelling. Ideal conditions for spawning are westerly winds, no turbidity and sea surface temperatures of 15-17°C.</p><p>Once at the spawning grounds, mating rituals involving fighting, guarding and sneaking begin. Large males pair and mate with mature females, while ‘sneaker’ males stealthily mate with paired-up females. Eggs are deposited on both hard and soft substrata mostly in sheltered bays along the South Coast and in large communal beds.</p><p>Potential fecundity is 17,000 eggs, and each egg capsule contains an average of 100-150 eggs. Eggs are contained in elongated (sausage-shaped) gelatinous casings, about 2.8 mm long and 2.0 mm wide. Capsules are attached to one another by threads that create large, spiralled clusters adhered to the seafloor. Development generally takes between 50 and 27 days at 12 and 17°C respectively.</p><p>Once hatched, planktonic larvae drift toward their nursery areas on the Agulhas Bank to feed and grow. Mature individuals then actively migrate eastwards to spawning grounds in summer.</p>",
