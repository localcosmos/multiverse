Mussels eaten by inserting the sharp bill between the valves when these gape, severing the adductor muscle and then scissoring out the flesh. Limpets are knocked off the rocks by a sharp jab to their posterior margin, turned over and wedged upside down while flesh scissored out.</p><p>World population was only about 4000 in 1980’s, but is now rising due both to restrictions on the driving of vehicles on beaches and to the invasion of rocky shores by the invasive Mediterranean mussel. This has vastly increased both absolute amount of food available, and also time for which this is available, as this mussel occurs higher in the intertidal than other native species.</p><p>Adults mostly sedentary and territorial, but young birds may migrate to nursery areas, often north of core adult range in Namibia, returning south after 2-3 years. Longevity up to 35 years.</p>",

Eggs 1-2, rarely 3, buff green or brown with black and brown lines and spots. Incubated by both parents, incubation time 27-39 days and young take a further 38 days to fledge. Eggs and chicks subject to mortality due to human disturbance, dogs on beaches, off road vehicles etc. and breeding success higher on islands than on mainland due to reduced disturbance.</p>",
