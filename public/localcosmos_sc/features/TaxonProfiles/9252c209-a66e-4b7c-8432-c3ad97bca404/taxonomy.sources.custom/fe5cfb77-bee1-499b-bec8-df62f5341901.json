They are best thought of as colonies formed from a few types of collaborating cells. Size and colony shape is often very variable within a species and accurate identification relies largely on examining the microscopic spicules that make up the skeleton. All are filter feeders, drawing in water through small opening on the body surface, removing fine particles and ejecting the waste water from one or more larger openings called oscula.</p><p>This very fragile species forms soft, fluffy bluish-grey amorphous sheets coating the undersides of rocks in the mid-intertidal, where it can be very common. It frequently overgrows other sedentary invertebrates, such as mussels or slipper limpets, and covers foliose seaweeds. The surface is lumpy and thrown into numerous small bumps and folds and the oscula are small and not obvious. The texture is very soft and the colony breaks up easily if touched. Although common the species appears to be undescribed.</p>",
