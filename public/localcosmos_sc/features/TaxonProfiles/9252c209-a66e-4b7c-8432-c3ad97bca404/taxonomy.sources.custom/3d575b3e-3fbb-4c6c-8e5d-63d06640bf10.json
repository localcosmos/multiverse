Eyes stalked and T-shaped with large bilobed cornea. Rostral plate smooth, either semi-circular or elongated to form point. Smooth carapace, thorax and abdomen. Short carapace partly covers thorax which is comprised of four segments visible from above. Six segments make up the abdomen with paddle-like swimming pleopods and ending in a characteristic telson and pair of uropods. Telson with a central smooth boss and four small, fixed teeth; without any small teeth between primary teeth. Colour in life unknown. Description (Barnard, 1950) describes a pinkish overall colour.</p>",

Relatively rare with no recent sightings and few preserved specimens. Known only from South African waters, shore to 88 m. Reported from False Bay at depths between 18–88 m. Like all mantis shrimps, the species possess highly specialized compound eyes with more photoreceptor types than any other animal. Each eye acts independently with a wide range of motion and has the ability to see ultra-violet and infrared light. Some species can even see polarized light with up to 16 visual pigments.</p>",

These two methods of striking prey define two broad functional groups within the Stomatopoda: the ‘spearers’ and the ‘smashers’. <i>Lysiosquilla capensis</i> is expected to be a nocturnal predator similar to other species of family Lysiosquillidae and will ambush prey from their burrows and attack by spearing prey with their toothed claws. With extremely high attack speeds, the mechanism involves a spring and latch structure located at the base of the raptorial claw which creates a spring-loaded strike. Spearers typically have slower attack speeds when compared to the smashers. It is thought that while smashers need to apply a greater force to stun their usually hard-shelled prey, spearers rely on a greater reach with their strategy of ambushing soft-bodied prey (Anderson <i>et al</i>. 2014). Expected to predate on soft-bodied prey such as shrimp and fish and be a prey species for predatory fish, seals, seabirds and dolphins.</p>",

Females carry and care for the eggs, holding and using the maxillipeds to clean and circulate water around them. Once hatched larvae are predatory and use their raptorial appendages to hunt. It takes 1 to 3 months for the larvae to go through several developmental stages before becoming adults. Lifespan unknown for species but mantis shrimps typically live 3 to 6 years, but some species have been known to live for 20 odd years.</p>",
