            "shortText": "<p>Sponges are the most primitive of multicellular organisms and lack most of the features typical of other groups, such as a head, limbs or distinct sensory or body organs. They are best thought of as colonies formed from a few types of collaborating cells. Size and colony shape is often very variable within a species and accurate identification relies largely on examining the microscopic spicules that make up the skeleton. All are filter feeders, drawing in water through small opening on the body surface, removing fine particles and ejecting the waste water from one or more usually larger openings called oscula.</p><p>Teat sponges are fairly easily identified to group level as they form massive, thick, usually yellowish pancake-like encrustations on rocky reefs and their surfaces bear numerous teat-like projections.</p><p>There are several similar species though and distinguishing between these is difficult. The two most common species on the west coast are<i> P. littoralis </i>which tends to be firm reddish-brown and is one the most common coastal sponges in the region and <i>P. atlanticus,</i> which is yellowish and occurs from 1-24 m depth along the entire west coast</p>",
