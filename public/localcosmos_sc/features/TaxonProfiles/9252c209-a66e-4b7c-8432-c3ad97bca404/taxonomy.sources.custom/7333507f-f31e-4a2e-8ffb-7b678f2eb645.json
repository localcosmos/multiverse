The characteristic 8-shaped burrow openings they leave in limestone rocks are a frequently noticed characteristic of these worms.</p>",

The burrow is created using acid secretions and the stout setae of the enlarged 5th body segment and is lined with sediment.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If burrows are made into the shells of living bivalves, such as oysters, the mollusc reacts by secreting additional shell material and this can result in slowing of the growth rate, roughening of the interior shell and even mud-blisters in the shell. These all lower the economic value of the oysters, so the worms are considered significant economic pests in the oyster industry.</p><p><br>Populations which burrow into rock are often overlooked when the worms are alive, as the sediment used to line the tubes makes them difficult to spot. Limestone rocks cast up on shore though, often bear numerous very characteristic 8-shaped burrows left by the dead worms and these are a frequent cause of curiosity. If the rock is broken,&nbsp; the burrows can be seen extending about 10 mm down into the rock. The worms tend to maintain a more or less constant feeding distance between individuals, so the burrow opening are often regularly spaced on the rock surface.</p>",
