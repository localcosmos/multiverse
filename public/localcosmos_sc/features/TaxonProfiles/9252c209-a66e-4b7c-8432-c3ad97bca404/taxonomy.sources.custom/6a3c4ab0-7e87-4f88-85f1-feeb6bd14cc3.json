Viewed microscopically, the zooecia are mostly flat and rectangular to rounded, with round to oval apertures and without conspicuous spines.</p><p>There are over 40 species in this genus, of which nearly 30 occur in the waters around southern Africa, so these are treated here as a group. Although the species are similar in overall structure, they differ in colour (usually white but some pink or brown), width of the lobes and microscopic structure of the zooecia.</p>",
