The large number of species makes species identification taxing, so only a genus level entry is provided here.</p><p>Species can be erect but are often creeping and have succulent leaves that are usually triangular in cross section and emerge opposite one another, often joined together at the base in a sheath. The flowers open in sunlight, vary in colour from white to pink or purple and petals are arranged in one to several cycles. The stamens are arranged to form a central cone.</p><p>The depicted species is common on coastal dunes in the South-Western Cape and forms small shrublets with radiating creeping stems and plump leaves. It has small pink flowers about 15 mm across and with a paler centre. We tentatively identify it as <i>R. macowanii.</i></p>",
