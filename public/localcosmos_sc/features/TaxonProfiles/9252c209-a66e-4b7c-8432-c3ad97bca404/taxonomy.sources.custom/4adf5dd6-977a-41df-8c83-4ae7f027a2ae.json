As a result, shores in this region have been greatly transformed by invasive species at all levels.</p><p>Frequently settles at extremely high densities. Growing individuals then quickly come into contact with one another and start to grow vertically as they compete for access to the water above. They then become extremely tall, elongated and fragile (much like overcrowded seedlings seeking the light) and as a result are easily displaced in storms, leaving distinctive bare patches on the rocks that remain coated by the calcareous bases.&nbsp;</p>",

As each animal is permanently attached to the rock the number of potential mates is limited by the length of the penis, which can be up to 3-times the diameter of the shell (relatively the longest of any animal group). The eggs are initially brooded in the mantle cavity and larvae later released. These swim and feed in the water column and go though several stages until ready to settle. Larvae are chemically attracted to older individuals, encouraging the formation of closely–packed colonies.</p>",
