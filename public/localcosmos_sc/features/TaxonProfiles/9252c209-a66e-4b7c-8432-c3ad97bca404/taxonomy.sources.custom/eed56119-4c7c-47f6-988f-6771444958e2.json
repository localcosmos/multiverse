Last two abdominal segments (urosome segments 2-3) fused.</p><p>There are several regional species in this specialized family of very small commensal amphipods, which includes only the two genera <i>Colomastix</i> and <i>Yulumara</i>, both of which are represented in South Africa. Although there are four described species of <i>Colomastix</i> in the region, of these only <i>C. pusilla</i> is found in the South Western Cape.
