The antennae are often very long and the second to fourth pairs of walking limbs elongate and setose for filter-feeding, while the last three pairs are much shorter and adapted for clinging. The fourth thoracic segment is often greatly elongated and/or laterally expanded.</p><p>This species has a greatly expanded fourth thoracic segment that is raised posteriorly into a large, blunt, upright projection. The colour pattern is also distinctive as both the elongate, robust antennae and the enlarged triangular thoracic segment are dark red-brown and the rest of the body white. Although several species in this genus are known from South Africa, this species appears to be new to science.</p>",
