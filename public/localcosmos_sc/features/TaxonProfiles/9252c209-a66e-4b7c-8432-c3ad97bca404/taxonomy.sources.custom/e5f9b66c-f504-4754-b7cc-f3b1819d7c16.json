Food collected on this sieve is constantly transported to the mouth. Very fine particles can be captured, allowing larvaceans to feed on minute particles as small as bacteria and unavailable to other filter-feeders with more conventional feeding organs (like gills). Once the house gets clogged with filtered material the entire structure is discarded and sinks slowly to the ocean floor and a new one is constructed. This happens several times a day! &nbsp;</p>",
