Each polyp lives in a separate, small stony cup, although individuals often live in groups. The outer surface of the cup may be parallel-sided, or strongly flared, but is generally smooth. The inner surface of the cup is ringed with radiating septa of varying number and design. The living polyps are normally red in colour.</p><p>Members of this genus have cups that are bent and expand dramatically from a narrow base, giving a tusk- or horn-like shape. There is both an outer circle of septa lining the cup and an inner circle and these also surround a central group of finger-like or scroll-like twisted central plates. As there are over 400 species in the genus globally and more than a dozen in the region, the local species are treated as a group here.</p>",
