All are obligatory symbionts of echinoderms, particularly crinoids, and while most are mobile and roam over the host, stealing food from it, others form galls or cysts around themselves, or are internal parasites living in the gut, body cavity or gonads.</p><p>This is a free-roaming, oval species found only on the arms of the elegant feather-star <i>Tropiometra carinata. </i>It has a yellow ground colour and a row of five oval black patches dorsally along each side, the overall effect closely matching the colour pattern of its host. It is the only free-living myzostomid currently known from South Africa, and the only species found in the temperate waters of the Atlantic coast. Other species have been seen and photographed on crinoids along the tropical east coast though and these may well represent other, undescribed species.</p>",
