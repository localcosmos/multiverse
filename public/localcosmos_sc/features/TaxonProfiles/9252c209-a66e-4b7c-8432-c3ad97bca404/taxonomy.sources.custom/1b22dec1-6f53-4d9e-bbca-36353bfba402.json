This species is highly unusual in that adults are able to secrete their own polystyrene-like floats using modified cement glands at the base of the stalk. Larvae originally have to settle on small floating objects, such as plastic pellets, feathers, <i>Spirula</i> shells or the like, but as adults they tend to form rounded aggregations hanging beneath their home-made floats.</p><p>Growth rate is extremely rapid and newly-settled individuals develop into reproductive adults within about 45 days. Although usually rare they occasionally wash up in very large numbers.</p>",
