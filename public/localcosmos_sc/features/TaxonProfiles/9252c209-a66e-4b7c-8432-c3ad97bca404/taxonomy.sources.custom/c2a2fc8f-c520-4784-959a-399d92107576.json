            "shortText": "<p>Diatoms are a very important group of typically single-celled, photosynthetic, planktonic organisms that together make up a significant proportion of the earth’s biomass. They are best known for possessing hard silica cases called ‘frustules’. Most species are solitary, but some join together to form colonial structures of various shapes including ribbons, fans, stars, or in this case larger colonies that resemble seaweeds.</p><p>The genus <i>Navicula</i> is a diverse genus containing over 1200 typically boat-shaped species, several of which form colonies. This species has been examined by specialists, who confirm the genus identification, but also that this represents an undescribed species. It is an unusual colonial species that forms a soft, jelly-like structure that look very like a brown seaweed and consists of clump of fairly thick, soft, knobbly, ‘fingers’’ firmly attached to the substratum.&nbsp; The most distinctive feature of the colony is its soft, slippery, jelly-like texture and semi-transparent appearance. The outer layer of the colony is formed of tightly-packed, more rectangular cells and the inner matrix is packed with typical boat—shaped cells.</p>",
