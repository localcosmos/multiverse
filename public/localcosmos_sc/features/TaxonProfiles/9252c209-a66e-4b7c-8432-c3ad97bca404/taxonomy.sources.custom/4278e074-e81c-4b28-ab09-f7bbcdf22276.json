However, as most species are very small, and many different genera are found on the seashore, species level identification is challenging. The tiny species depicted here is usually referred to as ‘<i>Bledius</i> sp’ and is best recognized by its unusual habits of creating dense networks of mole-like surface burrows on the upper tidal levels of sheltered sandy beaches.</p>",

Seldom noticed due to their small size and narrow bodies (meaning that they pass thought the collecting nets and sieves used by most researchers) but can be extremely common, reaching densities of thousands per square meter. At high tide, adults retreat into vertical burrows, which trap a bubble of air to breath while underwater. When the tide recedes they emerge and construct mole-like burrows just beneath the sand surface, picking up and cleaning individual sand grains of diatoms etc before packing them above their heads. Within a few hours the entire sand surface can become crazed with their meandering burrows. As the tide rises again they retreat back into their burrows. Best collected by digging up the sand and tossing this into a dish or puddle of water – the sand sinks while the beetles float!</p>",
