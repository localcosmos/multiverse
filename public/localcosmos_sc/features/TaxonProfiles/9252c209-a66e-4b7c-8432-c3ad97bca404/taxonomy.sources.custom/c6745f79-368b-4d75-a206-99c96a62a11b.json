This species should not be confused with the very-similarly named <i>L. anatifera</i> (see that entry). <i>L. anserifera</i> is characterized by its relatively thick, large shell valves, the main plate being almost quadrangular. The plates are separated by very narrow gaps and marked with distinct radiating ridges. The stalk is very short and usually orange. The main plate only (unlike <i>L. anatifera</i>) sometimes has a bright orange or yellow margin.&nbsp;</p>",

The availability of suitable habitats has now been vastly increased by the far greater abundance of man-made floating objects. These include ships, buoys, ropes etc., as well as discarded items including floating plastics, shoes, bottles, polystyrene, timber, etc. As a result, goose barnacles are probably much more common now than in the past. This species occurs on various natural and man-made objects, often seeming to prefer small objects, such as feathers, <i>Spirula</i> shells and small plastic debris.</p><p>Growth rate is extremely rapid and objects known to have been in the water only a few weeks can be recovered already covered in adult barnacles.</p>",
