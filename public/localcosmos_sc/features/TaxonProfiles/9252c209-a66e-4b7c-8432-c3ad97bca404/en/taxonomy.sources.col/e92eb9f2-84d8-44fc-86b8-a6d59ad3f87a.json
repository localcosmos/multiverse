The limpets cut distinct paths though the garden as they feed, creating edges into which the alga rapidly regrows. This regular cropping system has been shown to both stimulate productivity and reduce the amount of anti-herbivore chemicals produced by the algae!</p><p>Growth rates are quite hard to measure accurately in this species as shell shape changes during life and lengths of the ribs on the shell differ greatly between individuals (and are subject to erosion). Grown seems to be slow though, reaching a shell length of 60 mm after only 10-15 years.</p>",
