            "shortText": "<p>Klipfishes of the family Clinidae are smallish, elongate, laterally-compressed, bottom-dwelling fishes with a single dorsal fin stretching head to tail. The pelvic fin is inserted in front of the pectoral fin and consists of just 2–3 elongate rays (and one concealed spine) and the tail is rounded. All species are viviparous and the males have a prominent intromittent organ just behind the anus. The group is particularly common and diverse in intertidal and shallow water systems along the southern and western coasts of South Africa and together these make up the continent’s largest group of endemic fish species.</p><p><i>Clinus arborescens </i>is fairly slender and reaches quite a large size. The dorsal fin has 36-41 spines and 4-7 rays with the first 3 spines raised into a tall crest, which is followed by a deep notch extending almost to the body. This notch is visually enhanced by the upper membrane after the third spine being predominantly see-through, and this is the most useful identification character in the field. The anterior spines are all tipped by obvious clusters of cirri. The orbital cirrus is a short, flat, branching tree-like stalk (hence presumably the scientific name).</p><p>Body colour extremely variable with shades of pink or red with about 8 dark vertical half-bars running up the dorsal half of the body and onto the dorsal fin. There are usually scatterings of numerous small white and/or blue dots and a strong oblique band running from the eye across the operculum. The iris of the eye has about 6 equally-spaced brown spokes.</p>",

This one is reasonably easily recognised by the combination of largely colourful and often red colouration, strongly elevated crest on the dorsal fin, deep excavation following the third spine and bunches of cirri on the anterior dorsal spines. The “window” in the membrane behind the dorsal crest is diagnostic and separates this species from the similar Super klipfish <i>C. superciliosus</i>, Mosaic klipfish <i>C. musaicus</i> and Shy klipfish <i>C. exasperatus</i>. These are all common and occur next to each other in the same area although they segregate by microhabitat and show different behaviours, which gives useful identification clues in the field. This was observed by Tess Attwood during her UCT B.Sc. (Hons) project on different colour morphs in the clinids: <i>Clinus aborescens </i>prefers semi-open habitats that give “shrub”-like cover to hide at slightly deeper depth than the Super klipfish. Often hides in low algae such as upright wrack, red algae but also invertebrate overgrowths or feather stars. Can be approached at very close distance without swimming away.</p>",
