The burrow is created by rocking the shells against the walls of the burrow such that the sharp, rasp-like prickles on the exterior of the shell erode away the rock. As the animal grows, the burrow is extended deeper into the rock and becomes progressively wider, reaching to at least 20 cm depth in large individuals. The large siphons project from the gaping anterior end of the shell and reach our through the small aperture into the overlying water.</p><p>&nbsp;Apart from their unusual rock-burrowing habits, piddocks are also well known for their ability to produce&nbsp; a luminous mucus. The European species has been extensively exploited for human consumption since Roman times and as extracting and collecting piddocks involves destruction of their habitat, the species is now endangered and strictly protected in Europe. As only a small number of live colonies are known to exist in South Africa, these should probably also be protected against similar over-exploitation.</p>",
