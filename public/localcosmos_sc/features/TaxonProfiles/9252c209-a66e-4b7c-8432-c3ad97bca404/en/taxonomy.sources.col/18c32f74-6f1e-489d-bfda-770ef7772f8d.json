The head bears two pairs of round black eyes, three elongate antennae and two pairs of long tentacular cirri. The parapodia (lateral appendages) of the following body segments bear large sail-like dorsal cirri that curl over the back. Many individuals carry a chain of developing sexual buds from their posterior ends.</p>",

Another variation is to develop a single reproductive stolon, which has enlarged appendages and swims off in to the plankton, where is bursts and dies.
