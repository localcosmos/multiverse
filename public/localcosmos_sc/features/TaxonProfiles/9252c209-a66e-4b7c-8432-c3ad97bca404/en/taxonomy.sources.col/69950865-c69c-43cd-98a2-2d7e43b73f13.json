Firstly, they are important grazers, controlling the survival and hence density of kelps and other algae. &nbsp;Secondly, juvenile abalone often shelter under to spines of these urchins, where they gain protection from predators. Thus, removal of urchins greatly increases the mortality rate of young abalone and has a negative effect on recruitment and ultimately on the fishery. Thirdly, urchins form an important component of the diets of rock-lobsters, reef fish and various invertebrate predators, such as helmet shells.</p><p>In other parts of the world urchins are commonly harvested as food, the roe or eggs being the only part consumed.
