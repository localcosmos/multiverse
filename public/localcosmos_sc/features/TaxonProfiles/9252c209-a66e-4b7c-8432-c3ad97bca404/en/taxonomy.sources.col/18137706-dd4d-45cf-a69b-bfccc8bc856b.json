The outer lip is thickened (unlike in cone shells for example) and the inner lip bears a series of distinctive ridges or pleats. There is no operculum and in live specimens the broad foot is often brightly patterned. Species identification in much more complicated, as there are a large number of often localized species (over 60 in South Africa), many with similar colour patterns. Only a few of the more distinctive and common species are treated in this guide.</p><p>This species is one of the most common on the Cape Peninsula and is best recognized by a distinctive concavity in the inner margin of the outer lip near ‘shoulder’ level, but this is unfortunately never visible in images of live animals! Otherwise, it is identified by the attractive pink and brown (‘rosy’) flares that run longitudinally and spirally around the shell. The foot is off-white with bright white patches and red spots.</p>",
