In live animals the mantle, which itself can be dramatically coloured and textured, completely covers the shell, so it can be difficult to match images of live animals with those of dead shells (indeed some species are known only from dead shells). Although often thought of as a primarily tropical group, a wide diversity of endemic cowries are found in the cooler waters off South Africa.</p><p>The shell of this species is globular and the dorsal surface is sparsely to densely covered with dark brown spots against a pale apricot background. The density of these spots is so variable that the dorsal surface can vary from being almost white to almost completely dark brown! The ventral surface is always milky white though. The aperture is slightly curved posteriorly and is weekly toothed on the inner lip, the teeth not extending onto the ventral surface. The outer lip bears 14-21 stronger un-pigmented teeth that do extend across most of its width. In live animals the mantle is also extremely variable, ranging from a more usual salmon pink to black in some cases and may bear a few small papillae. The siphon is short, upturned and white and the tentacles are yellow.</p>",
