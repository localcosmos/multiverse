            "shortText": "<p>Very well-known species which is an iconic feature of shallow reefs in the region and is of great economic significance, previously as a wild fishery and now as an aquaculture crop.</p><p>Juveniles occur mostly under boulders in the intertidal and move down-shore as they grow. Small individuals lack the shell corrugation typical of adults and instead show fine spiral ridges. They often also develop attractive colour banding in the shell due to changes in the diet over time. Growth is slow, with sexual maturity being reached only after 8-10 years and the minimum legal collections size (when fishing of the wild stock was still permitted) of 114 mm only after about 13 years. The shell becomes thicker and more elevated with age and old animals can attain a wet weight of up to 3 kg and probably survive in excess of 30 years.</p><p>In former times abalone occurred in vast numbers on rocky reefs from about low tide to 20 m depth and formed the basis of a large and profitable fishery that reached a peak in 1965, when 2800 tonnes were harvested. Overexploitation and ‘mining’ of the stock, which had accumulated over many decades, plus uncontrolled illegal harvesting, have subsequently led to a collapse of the wild fishery, which was closed in 2008.</p><p>The wild fishery has now been replaced by a flourishing aquaculture industry, which propagates abalone from selected brood stock under controlled culture conditions in land-based tank facilities, where they are fed on either wild-harvested or cultured seaweeds, or on artificial pellet feeds. The animals grow faster and are sold at much smaller sizes than wild caught abalone, marked size being at a length of about 100 mm, which is attained after 5 years. Almost the entire production is exported to the Far-East and South Africa is now a leading global producer of abalone outside of Asia.</p><p>Apart from their economic value, abalone play, or at least used to play, various ecological roles kelp bed systems in the region. Despite their enormous abundance prior to human exploitation they were less important as grazers than might be thought, since they feed largely on drift rather than live algae. Juveniles also form prey for a variety of natural predators, including large reef fish (although these too are now greatly depleted) and octopus. The surfaces of their shells also provide habitat for numerous algae, as well as many sedentary and burrowing invertebrates.</p>",
