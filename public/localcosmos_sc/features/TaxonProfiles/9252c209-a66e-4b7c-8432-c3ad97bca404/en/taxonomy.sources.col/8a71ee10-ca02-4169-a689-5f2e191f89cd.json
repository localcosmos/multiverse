They are best thought of as colonies formed from a few types of collaborating cells. Size and colony shape is often very variable within a species and accurate identification relies largely on examining the microscopic spicules that make up the skeleton. All are filter feeders, drawing in water through small opening on the body surface, removing fine particles and ejecting the waste water from one or more usually larger openings called oscula.</p><p>This species is fairly easily identified by its enormous size, orange to red colour and wall-like shape, and is one of the most conspicuous sponges found on the region. Also characteristic are the numerous round openings on the upper surface, each of which is raided on a short turret.</p>",
