Predation rates are quite slow at less than 0.1 mussels per whelk per day, but as the whelks can reach densities of more than 500 individuals per square meter they are a significant cause of mussel mortality (500 whelks x 0.1 mussels per day x 365 days per year = 18 250 mussels killed per square meter per year!).
