The abdomen is held curled under the body and urosome segment 1 is unusually elongated (more than twice as long as segment 2). The second pair of uropods may be reduced and the third pair either reduced or completely absent.</p><p>This species is fairly easily recognized by the strong dorsal processes running along the back from the head to the second abdominal segment.</p>",
