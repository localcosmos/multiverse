            "shortText": "<p>Sponges are the most primitive of multicellular organisms and lack most of the features typical of other groups, such as a head, limbs or distinct sensory or body organs. They are best thought of as colonies formed from a few types of collaborating cells. Size and colony shape is often very variable within a species and accurate identification relies largely on examining the microscopic spicules that make up the skeleton. All are filter feeders, drawing in water through small opening on the body surface, removing fine particles and ejecting the waste water from one or more usually larger openings called oscula.</p><p>This species is fairly easily identified by its characteristic tree-like shape, consisting of an upright stem which then branches into a series of cylindrical upright stalks, each with a rounded tip. The surface texture is soft and fuzzy with tiny openings all over the surface and no large terminal oscula. Colour orange to red. Frequently acts as host to a white zoanthid, <i>Parazoanthus</i> sp. the polyps of which emerge all over the branches of the sponge.</p>",
