They then migrate to warmer waters of various regions in spring to breed. The African sub-population is thus transitory in our waters, passing through as they migrate between Antarctic feeding grounds and breeding grounds off east and west Africa. The northern migration peaks in our waters in June and July and the southern migration in September.</p><p>Undertake a variety of behaviours, including spectacular breaches and smacking of the water surface with the tail. Usually expose the tail flukes when diving, revealing their characteristic white underside and scalloped trailing edge.</p><p>Humpback whales are also well-known for their complicated songs, which are sung mostly on the wintering grounds and can last for 10–15 minutes. Almost all singers are large, single males and the songs are thought to either attract females or assert dominance between males.</p><p>Humpback whales were seriously depleted by whaling, with 24&nbsp;700 individuals from just the African population alone being killed between only 1908 to 1915. The species was given full protection from 1964, but thousands were still killed illegally thereafter, at least until an International Observer System was implemented in 1972. There has been a substantial recovery since that time and the East African population was estimated at 12&nbsp;000 in 2003 – which modelling suggests might be 79% of the original population.</p><p>The surfaces of humpback whiles are colonised by various other commensal species, including whale lice (<i>Cyamus</i>), whale barnacles (<i>Coronula</i>) and stalked barnacles (<i>Conchoderma</i>) –&nbsp; see those pages for further details.</p>",
