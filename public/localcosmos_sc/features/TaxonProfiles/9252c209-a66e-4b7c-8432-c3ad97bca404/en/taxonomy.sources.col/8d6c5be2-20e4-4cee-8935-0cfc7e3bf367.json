Particularly common in shells of the abalone <i>Haliotis midae</i>, the Turban shells <i>Turbo sarmaticus </i>and<i> T. cidaris, </i>as well as in the coralline alga<i> Heydrichia woelkerlingii</i>. The body form appears to have become modified to this unique habitat. The antennae have become adapted to filter-feeding, the limbs have become short, stout and spinose (reminiscent of those of hermit crabs) to grip the walls of the burrow and a plug–like structure on the dorsal surface appears to be use to close off the opening to the burrow when disturbed. Males are unknown and may look very different, since they are likely mobile and move between females, which remain captive within their burrows.</p>",
