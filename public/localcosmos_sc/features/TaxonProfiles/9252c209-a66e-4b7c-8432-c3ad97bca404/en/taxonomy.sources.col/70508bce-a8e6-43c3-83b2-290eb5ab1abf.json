South coast individuals are both rarer and smaller. Usually found on encrusting coralline algae, within which each individual creates a distinct home-scar. Large individuals often have juveniles living on their backs. &nbsp;Move off the home scar when immersed, but seldom range more then 60 cm from their scar. Feed on both coralline algae and diatoms, but also show a characteristic behaviour of trapping kelp fronds, the animal lifting the margin of its shell and snapping this down to capture and then graze on kelp fronds that drift beneath the shell in the waves.</p><p>Threatened by the invasive Mediterranean mussel <i>Mytilus galloprovincialis</i> that has moved into its characteristic habitat and now forms almost monospecific beds there, displacing the limpets from many sites where they were once common.</p>",
