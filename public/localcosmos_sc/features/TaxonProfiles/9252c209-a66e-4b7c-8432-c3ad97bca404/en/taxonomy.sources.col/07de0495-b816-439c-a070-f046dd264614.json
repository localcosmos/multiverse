Second pair of nippers are unusually powerful, but more conventional in form (subchelate), the palm without teeth and 5th segment extended into a lobe that protects hind margin of 6th segment (the ‘hand’) - see photograph under<i> L. spinicarpa</i>). Third abdominal side-plate has a hook-like, upturned tooth on hind corner.</p><p>Colour mottled orange with attractively white speckles on 5 pair of legs, which are held extended to the sides.</p>",
