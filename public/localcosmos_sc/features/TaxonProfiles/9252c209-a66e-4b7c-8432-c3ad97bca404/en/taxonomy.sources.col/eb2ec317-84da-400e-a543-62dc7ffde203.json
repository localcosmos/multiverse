It is noted that <i>U. capensis </i>is absent from estuaries (though present in Langebaan Lagoon, which has higher salinity than is common) and mostly found on the open coast, as it lacks the ability to osmoregulate below a salinity of 15-18 parts per thousand (ppt).

Known to produce small, but numerous eggs (often several 1000 per brood per female).
