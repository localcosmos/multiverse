            "shortText": "<p>Pycnogonids are bizarre animals that are sometimes referred to as ‘sea-spiders’ since both groups have 4 pairs of usually elongate, slender legs. However, since they are not closely-related to true spiders, we prefer to use the common name pycnogonids. The body consists of a head with a large tubular proboscis, a pair of grasping chelicerae, a pair of sensory palps and a pair of ovigerous legs. The latter are unique to this group and used both for grooming and, in the males, to carry the eggs. Behind the head is a compact to elongate trunk consisting of usually four segments, each of which bears large lateral processes onto which the legs are attached. At the end of the trunk is a small, usually conical, abdomen.</p><p>This species is readily identified in the field by the rounded knob in the centre of the back on each thoracic segment. The head also has a conical ocular tubercle with distinct black eyes and the proboscis is stout, cylindrical, tapering and extends directly forwards. Thoracic segments 3 and 4 are more or less fused with the junction, which is difficult to see. The legs are stout and also ornamented with small conical processes.</p>",

As the female releases her eggs these are fertilised by the male, who then gathers them up and carries them in a spherical mass attached to his ovigerous legs until they hatch.&nbsp;</p>",
