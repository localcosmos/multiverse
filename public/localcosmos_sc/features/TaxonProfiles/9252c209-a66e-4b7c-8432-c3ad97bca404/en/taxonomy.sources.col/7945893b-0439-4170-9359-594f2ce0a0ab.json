Most species are host-specific. During feeding the very long proboscis is extended and attached to the host using a terminal sucker. The mouth lacks a radula, but the jaws are modified into a spike-like stylet that penetrates the skin of the prey. The body fluids are then pumped up the proboscis using the muscular pharynx.</p>",
