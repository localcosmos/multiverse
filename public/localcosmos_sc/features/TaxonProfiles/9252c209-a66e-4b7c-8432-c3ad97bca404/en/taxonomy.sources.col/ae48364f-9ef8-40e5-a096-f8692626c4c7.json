Particularly common on the Agulhas Bank, where sometimes a dominant part of benthic biomass. Like other screw shells probably lives completely buried head-down into the sediment. Two channels through the sand communicate with the surface and water is drawn down one of these to the gills, which filter out fine particles and transport these in a string of mucus to the mouth, where the mucus string is raked in by the delicate radula. Wastewater is then expelled up the other channel back to the surface.&nbsp;</p>",
