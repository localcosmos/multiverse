In South Africa most abundant in shallow, sandy bays along the south and southeast coast between June and November, reaching maximum densities in September to October.</p><p>Usually seen fairly close inshore, singly or in small groups, the most common group being a cow-calf pair. Although females give birth to and raise their young along the coast, they feed very little feed over this period, a remarkable feat, considering that that they are suckling young at the same time.</p><p>Southern right whales were extensively exploited for centuries, as their large size, slow swimming speeds, inshore habits and good quality oil and baleen, plus the fact that they float when killed, all made them the ‘right’ whales to hunt! Over 100&nbsp;000 are thought to have been killed globally between 1770–1840 and by 1920 the global population had been reduced to an estimated 300 individuals, but even then, the species was only given complete protection in 1935. Between 1979 (when census counts were started) and 1997 the South African population recovered at over 7% per year to reach 3&nbsp;100. That is still, however, only 10–14 % of the estimated original population size, an indication of how common these magnificent creatures must once have been.</p><p>Feed by swimming forward with the mouth open and taking large volumes of water and prey. The mouth is then closed and the water expelled though over 200 enormous comb-like baleen plates, each over 2 m long that hang from the upper jaw and the food swallowed. The amount of food eaten is enormous and during the feeding season each whale has to eat about 1500 kg of tiny prey each day in order to survive through the non-feeding period. Even more remarkable is the fact that the prey are so small (one of the greatest size differences between predator and prey in the entire animal kingdom).</p><p>Placid whales that spend much of their time lolling at the surface. Often roll on their sides to show the broad, paddle-shaped flippers above the water. May also show the head above the surface (‘spyhopping’), slap the tail or flipper on the surface or breach, sometimes several times in succession.</p>",
