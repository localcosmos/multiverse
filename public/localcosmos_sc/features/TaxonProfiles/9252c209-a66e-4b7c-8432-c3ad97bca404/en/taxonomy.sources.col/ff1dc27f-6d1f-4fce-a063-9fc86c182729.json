These crabs are also occasionally seen on mudflats in the lower reaches of estuaries. Interestingly, Shore crabs have also been observed constructing burrows. They are adapted being on land for extended periods as they have a specialised mechanism for keeping their gills wet.</p><p>Can tolerate high salinity around 40% (normal ocean concentrations vary around 35%) for extended periods in order to withstand high shore pools that dry out in the sun. However, cannot tolerate low salinity of 20% for extended periods.</p><p>&nbsp;Populations are strongly male dominated. Males aggressively compete for shelter and mates, and show defensive behaviour of raising the pincers when threatened. Shore crabs are mostly nocturnal, rarely emerging during the day.</p>",
