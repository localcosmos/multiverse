Historically almost all these were on islands, presumably to avoid predation and disturbance by humans. Most of the largest breeding colonies now occur on the mainland though, either in conservation areas or mining areas with restricted access.</p><p>Spend much of their time at sea, but large males haul out on the breeding colonies in October and establish small territories there, the most desirable territories being those closest to the water. Cows arrive in November and the males establish harems of 10–40 females. The black pups are born shortly thereafter and remain with their mothers until they are weaned at an age of 8–10 months.</p><p>Often comes into conflict with the fishing industry, not only because the population consumes about 2 million tons of fish each year, a significant proportion of which comprises species also sought after by fisheries, but also because they may interfere with fishing operations. For example seals may take fish captured on lines or in nets, or themselves get caught in trawl nets or other fishing gear.</p><p>Historically fur seals have been extensively exploited and by the end of the 19th century populations had been greatly reduced and many colonies exterminated. Exploitation was subsequently controlled by legislation and finally banned in South Africa from 1973 (although it continues in Namibia). This has resulted in a substantial recovery and the population now stands at about 2 million individuals. One implication of this is that seals have recolonised islands which had become significant breeding sites for seabirds, resulting in another conflict between endangered bird colonies and seals!</p><p>Seals are themselves predated by Great white sharks, which gather around breeding colonies, where they attract shark-spotting tourist operations. Pups in mainland colonies are also taken by Black-backed jackals and Brown hyenas.</p>",
