The dorsal fin runs almost the full body length and is separated into an anterior spined section and a posterior rayed section. The pelvic fins are placed far forward, anterior to the bases of pectoral fins, and are reduced to one spine and a few rays.</p><p>Blennies are usually found sitting propped up on their pelvic fins in tide pools or on shallow reefs and sand and are very diverse and abundant on more tropical shores, with only a few species extending in the Western Cape.</p><p>This species has a prominent cirrus above the eye consisting of a broad base branching into several erect filaments with white tips. Head and body mottles brown and covered in numerous orange and dark spots, typically arranged into about 5 dark bars. There is a dark spot with a white upper margin (hence ‘two-eyed’ blenny) just behind each eye and typically a dark spot at the base of spines 3-5 of the dorsal fin.</p>",
