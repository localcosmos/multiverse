Most abundant in the lower intertidal, where it often occurs adjacent to and below the Mediterranean mussel <i>Mytilus galloprovincialis</i>, another invasive species which dominates the mid-intertidal zone across much the same range. The two species are often separated by a distinct boundary, with the paler and larger <i>Mytilus</i> above and smaller, darker <i>Semimytilus </i>below!</p><p>Usually occurs in extremely dense beds, newly-settled spat carpeting the rocks in densities exceeding 100 000 per meter squared. As growth proceeds self-thinning occurs, smaller individuals often physically undermining and forcing larger ones off the rocks (see image below). Since the mussels are small and tightly-packed, they offer less habitat for infaunal species than the larger <i>Mytilus</i>, so the beds are relatively devoid of other organisms. Small limpets, for example, are absent here, but common living on <i>Mytilus</i> shells. Being small, abundant and relatively thin-shelled this species probably forms a new and plentiful food source for various local predators, such as rock-lobsters, drilling whelks and kelp gulls and may thus benefit those populations, while displacing and outcompeting other sessile animals, such as limpets.</p><p>Recent studies show that the species is still expanding eastwards and has extended its eastward limit from Blauberg in 2010 to Hermanus in 2022.</p>",

Food particles filtered from the water are transported by cilia to the ventral edge of the gill and then forward to the mouth at the anterior (pointed) end, where they are sorted by the labial palps and lighter particles ingested. Inedible particles are rejected by the palps and ejected as ‘pseudo faeces’ which has not passed thought the digestive tract.</p>",

Spawning is usually synchronised via hormones released with the sperm and eggs and after spawning ‘spent’ individuals are thin and flaccid. Spawning is triggered by temperature changes and in temperate areas spawning occurs predictably in spring and autumn. However, in South Africa sea temperatures show much more seasonal stability and spawning tends to be more irregular and is probably triggered by short-term upwelling events. The numbers of eggs produced is enormous, running to the millions per mussel and hence billions per square meter of mussel bed! &nbsp;Larval development takes about 30 days and juvenile mussels (spat) sometimes settle in densities of hundreds of thousands per square meter. The way hermaphroditic gonads of this species affect reproduction (for example whether individuals can self-fertilise) is not known.</p>",
