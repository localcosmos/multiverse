Colour variable, including cream, pink or brown, may be plain or with radiating rays of darker colour, sometimes attractively marbled.</p><p>Animal much larger than shell, which simply perches on its back. Head projects into an elongate narrow snout with side branches and bears a pair of elongate tentacles at base. A few frilly, branching projections around margin of shell but these modest in number and size. Colour variable, often plain black or dark brown, but can be cream or pale pink (larger, darker, west coast and smaller, more mottled, south coast forms are recognized as separate subspecies).</p>",
