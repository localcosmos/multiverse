They are best thought of as colonies formed from a few types of collaborating cells. Size and colony shape is often very variable within a species and accurate identification relies largely on examining the microscopic spicules that make up the skeleton. All are filter feeders, drawing in water through small opening on the body surface, removing fine particles and ejecting the waste water from one or more usually larger openings called oscula.</p><p>This species is composed of a series of flat, upright blades which each narrow to a pointed tip. The texture is smooth and slightly hairy and there are small oscula along the edges of each blade. Colour in life orange-red.</p>",
