The parasite enters the mouth through the gills and the female then severs the blood vessels leading to the tongue, which withers and drops off. She then attaches onto the stub of the tongue and takes over its function, while the smaller male takes up a position beneath and behind the female. This is the only known example of a group of parasites actually functionally replacing the organs of their hosts!</p><p>Perhaps surprisingly, this is a fairly common adaptation and there are numerous species of tongue-replacement isopods in this and related genera, each specialising in a single host fish, or a related group of fish. In general the parasites appear to cause relatively little harm to their hosts, although some studies have shown parasitised fish to be thinner than un-parasitised ones. In the crowded conditions of cage culture farms, however, tongue replacement parasites (and other external isopod parasites) can become very abundant and cause significant mortality among host populations.</p><p>This particular species is the largest known tongue replacement isopod and is found only on the Carpenter seabream <i>Argrozona argyrozona</i>.</p>",
