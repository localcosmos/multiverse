Regularly commutes up to 10 km between roosting and foraging sites.</p><p>Flies with neck outstretched and lands belly-first in water, often using depressed tail as a brake. Sits low in the water with only head, neck and upper back exposed and forages by diving and seizing prey underwater. Feeds on bouts, each comprising a series of short dives of about 30 seconds with brief rests between. Longer rest periods between foraging bouts.</p>",

Incubation 27-28 days and brooded by both parents with changeovers at least twice a day. Chicks fledge at 49-56 days.</p>",
