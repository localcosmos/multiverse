There are 10 long, strongly-branching, tree-like (dendritic) tentacles arranged into inner and outer cycles of 10 tentacles-each.

All existing samples are also from &lt;20 m depth, where ships would be unable to operate. Lives buries in course sand with only the anterior end and long tentacles projecting upwards from the surface, while the body is buried in a U-shape, such that the anus again reaches to the sand surface. The large white and speckled tentacles are held upright into the water column to intercept floating particles passing in the current.</p>",
