They have elongated, generally smooth, conical shells that are mostly plain peach-coloured. The foot is extremely large with two tiny ‘tails’ at the posterior end and the operculum is much smaller than the aperture. The siphonal canal is very short and there is often a large shiny area (callus) extending from the inner lip of the aperture.</p><p>Some regional species are hard to distinguish from one another, but this one is easy to identify by virtue of the distinct steps separating the whorls of the shell and the fine spiral ridges around each whorl. There are often slight bumps and reddish-brown marks on the shoulders of the whorls. The callus is small and the operculum small and un-serrated.</p>",
