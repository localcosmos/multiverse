Although cones are most diverse in tropical seas, a few species extend into the cooler waters of the Western Cape.</p><p>This species is fairly large with an unusually elongate and slender shell (hence common name) with a fairly pointed and extended spire and is normally pale yellow to brown in colour with brown spots or flames.
