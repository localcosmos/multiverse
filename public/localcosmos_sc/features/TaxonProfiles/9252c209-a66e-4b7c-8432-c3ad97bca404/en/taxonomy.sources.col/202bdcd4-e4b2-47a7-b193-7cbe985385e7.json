            "shortText": "<p>Blennies are a diverse group of small, elongate, benthic fish that lack scales and usually have a blunt face with eyes placed close together high on the head and a prominent cirrus above each. The dorsal fin runs almost the full body length and is separated into an anterior spined section and a posterior rayed section. The pelvic fins are placed far forward, anterior to the bases of pectoral fins, and are reduced to one spine and a few rays.</p><p>Blennies are usually found sitting propped up on their pelvic fins in tide pools or on shallow reefs and sand and are very diverse and abundant on more tropical shores, with only a few species extending in the Western Cape.</p><p>This species has a prominent orange-red cirrus above each eye consisting of a central elongate tapering filament, from the base of which several other filaments emerge. In males the cirrus is larger than in females and it can be bright red. &nbsp;Head large and very blunt with large mouth bearing thick lips. Body mottles brown with fleshy fins (specially pectorals) and numerous dark spots, typically arranged into about 5-6 dark bars.</p>",
