They are laterally compressed, with a single continuous dorsal fin and forked tail. Most species are diurnal and form schools on shallow temperate reefs (although some are territorial and/or extend to 450 m depth). Many species change sex as they grow.</p><p>This well-known species grows to a larger size and is more elongate that most others in the family. It has a long, sloping forehead, thick lips and a strongly protrusible mouth. Colour silver with 7 faint dark vertical bars that become less prominent in large adults.</p>",

When feeding in shallow water the tail can sometimes be seen waving above the water surface.</p><p>Reach sexual maturity at the unusually large size of 54–65 cm (at age 5–6 years) and can reach an age of 25–30 years. Highly sought after commercial and recreational angling fish and currently overexploited. IUCN conservation status Endangered.</p>",
