They are un-segmented, worm-like animals with a cylindrical body that lacks appendages, other than a characteristic anterior, horseshoe-shaped ring of filter-feeding tentacles called the lophophore and a bulbous ampulla at the posterior end. The gut is U-shaped and the anus is situated at the anterior end, just outside the ring of tentacles.</p><p>This species lives single in a tube made of sand grains and shells attached to the surface of a rock, from which it extends a single circular crown consisting of a row of longer outer and another of shorter inner tentacles. The body is yellowish and the tentacles transparent but each decorated at intervals with elongated white spots.</p>",

They are anchored into the tube by the swollen bulb at the posterior end of the body (the ampulla). Other than being able to retract rapidly when disturbed, they are slow moving. The lophophore can be jettisoned and regenerated, so specimens lacking lophophores are common in benthic samples.</p><p>Some smaller species form extensive colonies, but larger species (such as this one) are normally solitary. The South African specimens were found emerging from holes in limestone rocks that had been collected to decorate an aquarium. &nbsp;</p>",
