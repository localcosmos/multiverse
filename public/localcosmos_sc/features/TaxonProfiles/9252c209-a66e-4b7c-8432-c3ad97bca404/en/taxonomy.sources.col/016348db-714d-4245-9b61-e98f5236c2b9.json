They were once included within the Bryozoa, but have now been moved to a separate phylum (largely because the mouth lies inside the crown of tentacles, as opposed to outside in the Bryozoa). Globally, they comprise about 150 species of small, sessile, almost exclusively marine animals with long stalks and goblet-shaped bodies topped by a ring of 8-30 solid tentacles. Some are solitary but most are colonial, with individuals arising at intervals from a creeping stolon.</p><p>This species is colonial and found attached to other invertebrates, in the case depicted the carapace of a West Coast Rock Lobster and the Rock crab.&nbsp;</p>",
