They are laterally compressed, with a single continuous dorsal fin and forked tail. Most species are diurnal and form shoals on shallow temperate reefs, but some larger species are territorial and/or extend to 450 m depth. Many species change sex as they grow.</p><p>This well-known angling species is easily recognized as an adult due to its plain silvery colour and its unusually enlarged, blunt head with its rounded snout and powerful jaws, which are equipped with 4 prominent incisors and rows of crushing molars.</p><p>Juveniles are more commonly seen and lack the much-enlarged head, but still have a blunt, rounded snout. They also have small horizontal rows of darker spots along the body. In smaller individuals the fins are distinctively orange.</p>",
