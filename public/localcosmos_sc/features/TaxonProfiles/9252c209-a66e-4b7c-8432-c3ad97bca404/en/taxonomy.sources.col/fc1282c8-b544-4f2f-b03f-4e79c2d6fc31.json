Known to be a prolific ecosystem engineer as it creates deep burrows (over a meter deep) manipulating sediments at high rates of up to 12.14 kg/m2/day. Water gets pulled into the burrow resulting in phytoplankton getting trapped on the sediment of the burrows walls. This is filtered by the sandprawn and food particles are subsequently eaten, and the cleaned sand is ejected from the burrow to create a small ‘volcano’ at the opening. The process of filtering sediment or ‘bioturbation’ positively affects the environment as it enhances bacteria, buries phytoplankton such as diatoms and inhibits larval settlement of many other species. In the process, sandprawns oxygenate the sediment and reduce eutrophication (build-up of nutrients causing algal blooms) by removing phytoplankton from the water column.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Sandprawns are susceptible to human activities as they are a sought-after live bait for fishing, taken by recreational anglers through prawn pumps. They are also impacted by trampling as they share their habitat with beachgoers. Increased trampling, and more so too excessive ‘pumping’ compromises sandprawn habitat and its structural integrity, with knock-on implications on the surrounding ecosystem and diversity. Studies have shown that the % decline in harvested populations is far greater than just the number of prawns taken For example, Branch showed that in a population where only 6–13% of the population was harvested, they observed a 70% decline in the population.</p>",

As in other decapod crustaceans, females attach the spermatophore (passed from the male) to the ventral side of the pleon (hind body), where the eggs are fertilized as they get spawned and then attached to the pleopods underneath the tail. The large and relatively few eggs (up to 200 per female) are then carried by the female for about 30 days before they hatch into small juveniles that, instead of swimming in the plankton, dig small side-burrows out of the parental burrow.</p>",
