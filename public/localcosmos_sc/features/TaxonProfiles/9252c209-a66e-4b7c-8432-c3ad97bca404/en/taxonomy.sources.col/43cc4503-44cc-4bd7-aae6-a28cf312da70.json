At a length of approximately 40 mm surviving juveniles move onto the stem or stipe of the kelp and progressively adopt the characteristic elongated, curved shape to allow themselves to remain tightly attached to the narrow, rounded shape of the stipe.</p><p>Many kelps host numerous juveniles on the head and fronds (up to 46), but usually only one or two adults are found on the stipes of each individual kelp, suggestive of a high juvenile mortality rate. Their grazing activity probably helps maintain the stipes free of epiphytic algae and thus reduces drag, in turn reducing the likelihood of the kelp being uprooted during storms.</p><p>Kelp limpets are a favoured food item of octopuses, which climb up into the kelp canopy and drill into their fairly thin shells.</p><p>Growth rates have not been measured in this species.</p>",
