Incredibly strong legs and hooked dactyls make them perfectly adapted to the wave-exposed shores which they dominate. Can also be observed on anthropogenic habitats such as jetties, quays, artificial reefs and also the bottom of ships (which could explain its widespread distribution). Do not occur in estuaries, as they cannot tolerate salinities below 70% seawater. Cape rock crabs are an important prey species for many kelp forest inhabitants, especially the Common octopus (<i>Octopus vulgaris</i>) that can reach into crevices and other hiding spots to pull the crab out. Escape responses are often observed as Cape rock crabs are excellent swimmers, using their flattened legs and hair fringes on them as efficient paddles, fleeing onto higher reefs, the water column, the kelp canopy, or even onto exposed intertidal rocks where the octopus can’t easily follow.</p>",
