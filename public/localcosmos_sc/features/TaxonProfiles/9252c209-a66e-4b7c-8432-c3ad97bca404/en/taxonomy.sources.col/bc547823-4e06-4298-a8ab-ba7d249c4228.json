Underside white, extending backwards as three streaks, one along the midline of the belly and the other two curving up the flanks. Sides on front half of body grey.</p><p>Sexes difficult to distinguish in the field, but differ in shape of a small white patch covering the genital area, which comes to a point in males and widens out to cover mammary slits in females.</p>",

Also seen surfing in coastal waves and may leap well clear of the water, re-entering vertically and with almost no splash.</p><p>South African populations have been reported to undertake diurnal movement patterns, moving offshore late in the day to feed on prey that rise to the surface at night and returning inshore to rest and socialize in the mornings. Dives are usually short in duration, often less that one and seldom more than two minutes and mostly to depths of less than 50 m (max 147 m).</p><p>Echolocation clicks occur in a narrow high-frequency band of 125–130 kHz when foraging and travelling, but at lower frequency and broader bandwidth when socialising. Do not whistle like many other dolphins.</p><p>Total population has been estimated at 6300 individuals, but there is a large error margin around this estimate.
