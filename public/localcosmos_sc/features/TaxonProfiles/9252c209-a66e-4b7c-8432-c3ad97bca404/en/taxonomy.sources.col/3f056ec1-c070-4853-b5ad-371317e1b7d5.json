Swimming direction can be controlled by opening and closing different parts of the mantle edge. &nbsp;The curved shape of the lower shell ensures that the scallop always settles right way up after a bout of swimming. Edge of the mantle decorated with a series of conspicuous shiny simple eyes, each borne at the base of a sensory tentacle. These are used to sense the presence of predators.</p><p>Large scallops are highly sought after as seafood and this species is certainly big enough to be eaten, but the wild stocks are too small to sustain a commercial fishery. There has, however, been recent interest in culturing this species for human consumption and growth rates attained in culture are comparable to those found in other famed species.</p>",
