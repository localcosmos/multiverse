Feed mostly by day, but foraging trips may last several days. Feed by pursuit diving and can dive up to 130 m depth, but most dives to less than 50 m. Dive duration typically about 1 minute, but over 4 minutes reported. Often hunt co-operatively, herding shoals of fish together and seizing them from below. Prey may be swallowed underwater. On land, walk upright, hopping over small gaps and sliding down inclines.</p><p>Overall numbers have declined drastically over past century from about 2 million to 20 000 breeding pairs. Causes include harvesting of eggs and exploitation of guano on breeding islands, depletion of food due to competition with commercial fishing operations, oil spills and competition with expanding seal populations, which have eliminated penguins from several breeding islands. Although previously restricted to islands due to high predation pressure on mainland, three mainland colonies are now established and some of these, notably Boulders Beach on Simonstown, have become significant tourist attractions.</p><p>When undergoing their annual (synchronized) moult, penguins are unable to feed at sea, as their feathers are not waterproof, so they fast during this period, which lasts about 3 weeks, losing almost half their body weight. Voice a loud donkey-like braying, hence the alternative common name Jackass penguin.</p>",
