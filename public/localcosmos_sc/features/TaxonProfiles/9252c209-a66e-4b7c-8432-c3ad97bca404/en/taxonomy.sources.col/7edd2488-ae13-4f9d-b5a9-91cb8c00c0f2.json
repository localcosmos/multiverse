Eggs usually 2-4, grey to yellowish, streaked or spotted with browns or greys at broad end. In Western Cape mostly laid in July-November. Incubation time 13-14 days, fledglings leave nest after 14-18 days, but continue to be fed by adults up to 20-25 days. Adults with newly-fledged young may feign injury to distract predators.</p>",
