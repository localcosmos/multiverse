The pelvic fin is inserted in front of the pectoral fin and consists of just 2–3 elongate rays (and one concealed spine) and the tail is rounded. All species are viviparous and the males have a prominent intromittent organ just behind the anus. The group is particularly common and diverse in intertidal and shallow water systems along the southern and western coasts of South Africa and together these make up the continent’s largest group of endemic fish species.</p><p>This slender, strongly laterally-compressed species has a small head and mouth and a long, slender peduncle to the tail. The dorsal fin has 25–28 spines and 3–4 rays, with the first three spines distinctly raised into a crest separated by a deep notch from following spines. There is no tentacle above the eye.</p><p>The colour is extremely variable, but is usually fairly plain green, yellow, red or brown, often with paler horizontal bars. The body colour extends onto the dorsal fin, which has a series of pale windows after ever 2–3 spines. Pale windows also present in tail and anal fin. Eyes usually with three darker spokes forming a Y.</p>",
