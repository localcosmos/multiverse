Head and neck relatively enlarged compared to other species and bill hooked. Some sexual dimorphism in adults, males having wider head, wider, less-domed carapace and longer tail and claws than females. Juveniles cannot be sexed externally.</p><p>Colour dark reddish brown with underside pale yellow.</p>",

Courtship and mating take place at sea, following which the females come ashore and lay batches of about 100 eggs at a time, placing these into holes about 50–80 cm deep dug above the high-water mark of sandy tropical beaches using a scooping action of the rear flippers. Several clutches of eggs are laid between October and February in one season, following which the female may not return to breed for 2–3 years. In South Africa breeding is restricted to the coast of northern KwaZulu-Natal.</p><p>Incubation lasts about 80 days and emerging juveniles are 4–5 cm long and weigh only about 20 g. As with other turtles, the sex ratio of hatchlings is determined by temperature, those incubated below 30°C being mostly male and those at higher temperatures female. Most hatchlings emerge at night to minimize predation and high surface temperatures and may be subject to intense predation by ghost crabs and seabirds during their journey to the ocean. They navigate seaward based on the brighter light created by reflection of moon and stars on the sea and so can become disorientated by the lights of buildings on the landward side. Juveniles live out in the open ocean before reaching maturity and returning to the coast to breed.</p>",
