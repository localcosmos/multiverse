May also become more nocturnal in urban habitats, possibly in an attempt to minimize encounters with dogs and humans. Some individuals have become habituated to humans and there are increasing reports of animals that have taken up residence in urban areas, that approach and interact with divers, or that habitually approach boats at landing sites seeking food, etc.</p><p>The droppings (spraints) are deposited in specific toilet sites situated close to the dens and both reveal the presence of otters in the area and can be used to analyse their diet.</p><p>Excellent swimmers and forage in rough inshore waters, feeling in underwater caves and overhangs for fish, crabs and lobsters. Usually emerge onto rocks in the intertidal to consume the prey and this is when they are most commonly seen.</p>",
