The shrimp has various colour morphs and patterns, mimicking that of its respective feather star host, and hence ranges from longitudinal red and yellow stripes to a spotted panther-like pattern.</p><p>The carapace (upper hard shell) is somewhat stout, leading into a straight rostrum (projection to the front) that is roughly as long as the carapace. The rostrum is smooth with a sharp spine at the end, and 2-3 ventral teeth on the underside. The diagnostic character separating this species from other South African species is a whorl of setae on the tip of the third maxilliped (mouth part). Since specimens would need to be collected and dissected to see this character, the identification in the field by its unique habitat and behaviour is highly useful.</p>",
