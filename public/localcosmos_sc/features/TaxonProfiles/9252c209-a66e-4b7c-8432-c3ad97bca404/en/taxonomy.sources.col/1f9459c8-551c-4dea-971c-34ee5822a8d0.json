The second antennae are large, robust and sometimes brightly-coloured. The second pair of claws (gnathopod 2) are very large and powerful. The abdomen is held curled under the body and urosome segment 1 is unusually elongated (more than twice as long as segment 2). The second pair of uropods may be reduced and the third pair either reduced or completely absent.</p><p>This species has a smooth body lacking any dorsal projections and is pale, mottled brown in colour. Distinctive combs of spines along the inner branches of the large uropods1 and 2 distinguish it from other local species. It is also easily identified by its unique habitat within the body cavities of the large ascidian <i>Pyura spolonifera </i>(Redbait).</p>",
