            "shortText": "<p>Klipfishes of the family Clinidae are small, elongate, laterally-compressed, bottom-dwelling fishes with a single dorsal fin stretching head to tail. The pelvic fin is inserted in front of the pectoral fin and consists of just 2–3 elongate rays (and one concealed spine) and the tail is rounded. All species are viviparous and the males have a prominent intromittent organ just behind the anus. The group is particularly common and diverse in intertidal and shallow water systems along the southern and western coasts of South Africa and together these make up the continent’s largest group of endemic fish species.</p><p>This relatively slender species has a low dorsal fin with 32-38 spines, followed by only 2-4 rays (the lowest number of any <i>Clinus </i>species). The first few spines are not raised into a crest, but there is a distinct notch between spines 3 and 4. There are small, simple cirri at the tips of the first 15 or so spines, but these are not obvious. Pigmentation extends onto the dorsal fin membranes except between the last few rays, where there is a distinct clear window. The tail membrane is also clear. There is a small cirrus above the eye that resembles a raised hand with the fingers extended.</p><p>Body colour is variable, as with most clinids, but most commonly speckled white or pale green or brown, with about 7 darker vertical bars, these often alternately darker and lighter. Eye colour divided into segments of white and dark and often marked oblique white lines from eye across cheek.</p>",
