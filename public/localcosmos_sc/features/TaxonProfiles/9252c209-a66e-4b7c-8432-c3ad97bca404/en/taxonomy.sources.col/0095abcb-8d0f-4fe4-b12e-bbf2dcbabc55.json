Food particles filtered from the water are transported by cilia to the ventral edge of the gill and then forward to the mouth at the anterior (pointed) end, where they are sorted by the labial palps and lighter particles ingested.

Spawning is usually synchronised via hormones released with the sperm and eggs and after spawning ‘spent’ individuals are thin and flaccid. Spawning is triggered by temperature changes and in temperate areas spawning occurs predictably in spring and autumn. However, in South Africa sea temperatures show much more seasonal stability and spawning tends to be more irregular and is probably triggered by short-term upwelling events. The numbers of eggs produced is enormous, running to the millions per mussel and hence billions per square meter of mussel bed! Larval development takes about 30 days and juvenile mussels (spat) sometimes settle in densities of hundreds of thousands per square meter.</p><p>In this species males make up 66% of the population and females only 34%. Spawning seems to take place three times a year although the timing and intensity of spawning events differs considerably between years.</p>",
