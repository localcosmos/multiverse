            "shortText": "<p>Klipfishes of the family Clinidae are small, elongate, laterally compressed, bottom-dwelling fishes with a single dorsal fin stretching head to tail. The pelvic fin is inserted in front of the pectoral fin and consists of just 2–3 elongate rays (and one concealed spine) and the tail is rounded. All species are viviparous and the males have a prominent intromittent organ just behind the anus. The group is particularly common and diverse in intertidal and shallow water systems along the southern and western coasts of South Africa and together these make up the continent’s largest group of endemic fish species.</p><p>This slender, laterally compressed species has an elongate head, a small mouth and a long, slender peduncle to the small tail. The dorsal fin has 30–36 spines and 2–4 rays and first three of the spines are distinctly raised above the fourth and following ones. The colour is extremely variable and can change depending on the algal species on which the specimen is living (see very variable images in references below). The body can have longitudinal brown or white bands, may be mottled in pinks and brown or can be fairly plain green, brown (as depicted here) or red. There consistently tends to be a series of wavy blue-green lines radiating from the eye back to the operculum (and forwards to the mouth) and this is perhaps the best way to identify the species.</p>",
