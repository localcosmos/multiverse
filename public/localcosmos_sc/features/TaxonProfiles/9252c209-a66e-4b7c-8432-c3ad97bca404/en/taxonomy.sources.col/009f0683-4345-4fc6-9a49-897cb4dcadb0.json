When disturbed can lead high into the air, landing clumsily and staggering back into an upright position. At some sites populations may extend well above high watermark and into the dunes. There have been numerous reports of beach hoppers invading coastal properties in large numbers and dying in drifts inside homes. Some home-owners even erect barricades to keep them out!</p>",
