Mantle surface with wrinkled skin and very small granules but otherwise smooth and without any larger papillae, cirri or tubercles. Each arm has about 60-80 suckers that are irregularly spaced. The genus <i>Eledone </i>is defined by a single row of suckers, however this species is an exception in having a non-uniform single to double zigzag row of suckers. Suckers on arm pairs 1-3 particularly enlarged around sucker numbers 6-10 (counted from the mouth). Right third arm hectocotylised, meaning it has a distinct spermatophoral groove along the side as well as a modified arm tip to deliver a sperm package to the female. All non-hectocoylised arm tips have bunches of long, sensory finger or brush-like projections instead of suckers (hence the name ‘brush-tip’). It is still unclear but possible that the brush-like arm structures only occur in males. Unable to change colour in the same way as other octopus species, and appearance is always uniformly red-brown and easy to identify.</p>",

Probably more common than thought, but rarely seen due to its small size, secretive lifestyle, and since it lives along the highly wave-exposed west coast that can be difficult to access.</p>",
