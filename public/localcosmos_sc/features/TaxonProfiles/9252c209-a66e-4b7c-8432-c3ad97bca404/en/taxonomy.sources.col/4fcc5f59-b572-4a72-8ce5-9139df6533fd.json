            "shortText": "<p>Klipfishes of the family Clinidae are small, elongate, laterally-compressed, bottom-dwelling fishes with a single dorsal fin stretching head to tail. The pelvic fin is inserted in front of the pectoral fin and consists of just 2–3 elongate rays (and one concealed spine) and the tail is rounded. All species are viviparous and the males have a prominent intromittent organ just behind the anus. The group is particularly common and diverse in intertidal and shallow water systems along the southern and western coasts of South Africa and together these make up the continent’s largest group of endemic fish species.</p><p>This very elongated, slender, sand-dwelling species has eyes on top of the head and the lower jaw distinctly projecting. The dorsal fin has its origin above the vent and had 38–43 spines and 11–15 slightly longer rays. Pelvic fin consisting of 3 upturned rays connected by a membrane, like a frog-foot. Body colour cream, with a row of grey, darker-edged saddles dorsally and smaller spots along the flanks.</p>",
