The pelvic fin is inserted in front of the pectoral fin and consists of just 2-3 elongate rays (and one concealed spine) and the tail is rounded. All species are viviparous and the males have a prominent intromittent organ just behind the anus. The group is particularly common and diverse in intertidal and shallow water systems along the southern and western coasts of South Africa and together these make up the continent’s largest group of endemic fish species.</p><p>This species has 38 spines and 8 rays in the dorsal fin, of which the first 3 spines are raised into a tall crest, but with only a shallow notch between the 3rd and 4th spines. First 6 spines also have a small filament at their tip. Cirrus above eye a small, narrow stalk ending in a few thin, tapering branches.</p><p>Colour primarily formed of about 5 longitudinal brown or green broken stripes consisting of alternating light and dark blocks. Head above middle of eye dark with radiating broken stripes, but below eye head characteristically pale yellow or white with a diagonal darker stripe.</p>",
