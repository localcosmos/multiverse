Their bodies are soft and laterally flattened, the antennae generally long and hairy, the claws weak or absent and the first two pairs of walking legs contain cloud-like spinning glands used to secrete the tubes.</p><p>There are more than a dozen hard to identify species in the region and these are separated largely by detailed structures of the last pair of walking legs (see Griffiths, 1976 for guide to species). This species is particularly large and common and is featured here mainly because it can be fairly readily identified by the conspicuous rounded lobe on the posterior of the last walking leg.</p>",
