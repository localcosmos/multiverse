In males it is enlarged and terminates in an unusual keyhole-shaped notch, but in females the margins are entire. In both sexes the uropods are unusual in that the inner branch, which bears a row of dorsal tubercles, is slightly forked at its tip, whereas the outer branch is smooth and ends in an outwardly-curved point.</p>",

Now that we have found males (see that entry) we find that the male pleotelsons of both species are similar.</p><p>The species do still differ in the size and form of dorsal tubercles, which are much larger and more flat-topped in <i>S. polytylotos</i> and smaller and more conical in <i>S. microtylotos</i>. The distinction between these species is thus retained, although this should be confirmed by genetic analysis, as there is considerable variation on dorsal ornamentation between individuals.</p><p>Note that males of <i>Parisocladus</i> also show keyhole-shaped openings in the pleotelson, the function of which remains unknown. <i>Parisocladus </i>lack rows of dorsal tubercles on the thorax though.</p>",
