When observed alive they can become extremely elongated, but when collected or disturbed they contract and adopt a much shorter and thicker shape. The South African fauna is poorly studied and many species doubtless remain undescribed.</p><p>Nemertines occur both on rocky habitats and burrowing into soft sediments. This species is the only common nemertine found on exposed sandy beaches in the region and is plain yellowish-white with a pointed head and no other body markings. Unlike many rocky shore species it does not change its body shape much and is typically 2-3 mm in width and 20-40 mm long.</p>",
