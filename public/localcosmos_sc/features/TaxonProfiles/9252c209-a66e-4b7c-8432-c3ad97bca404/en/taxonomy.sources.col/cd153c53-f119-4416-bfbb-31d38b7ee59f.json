Attachment to the rocks is relatively weak.</p><p>Unusually (relative to other limpets) feeds during low tide to prevent being displaced by wave action. Rock-pool populations feed both by day and by night, but those on the open rock feed only during nocturnal low tides to avoid desiccation.</p><p>The respiratory system in this group is unusual in that they posses a lung-like pulmonary chamber that opens on the right side via a tubular siphon. The inner surface of this chamber is highly vascularised and also contains a secondary gill, allowing the animals to breath both in air and in water. If one turns the animal upside down the siphon can been seen opening and closing, much like the opening to the lung of a land snail.</p><p>The tissues of this species are laden with milky toxic mucus that deters predators.</p>",
