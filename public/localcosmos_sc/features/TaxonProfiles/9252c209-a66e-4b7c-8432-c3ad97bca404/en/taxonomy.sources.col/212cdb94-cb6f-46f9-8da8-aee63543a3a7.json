It was first reported in South Africa by Griffiths (1979), who identified it as <i>Amphithoe humeralis, </i>a species previously known only from the Pacific coast of North America. However, Milne and Griffiths (2013) concluded that it merited separation from that northern hemisphere species, which had in the interim been moved to the genus <i>Peramphithoe</i>, and thus re-named the South African form as <i>P. africana</i>. To further complicate matters Peart (2017) amalgamated <i>Peramphithoe</i> into the genus <i>Sunamphitoe</i>, so the species now becomes <i>S. africana</i>!</p>",

Chambers contained up to 121 individuals, comprising usually 2-3 adults and their developing young.</p>",
