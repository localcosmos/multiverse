May form groups when resting and curls into a tight ball when disturbed, wrapping the tail over the head – hence the common name shyshark.</p><p>This species (like many other shysharks) have a special green fluorescent protein in their skin that makes them glow in the dark! This biofluorescence is possible due to the absorption of the ocean’s blue light which is then emitted by the protein as a greenish glow. It is thought this ability is useful in communication and finding a mate, which is backed up by the fact that these sharks have special eyes that can see this glow.</p><p>Mature at a length of about 40–50 cm at an age of about 7 years. Longevity estimated as at least 22 years. These sharks are caught as bycatch during demersal trawls and have seen their population decline in the last few decades, hence giving them an Endangered status on the IUCN Red List.</p>",
