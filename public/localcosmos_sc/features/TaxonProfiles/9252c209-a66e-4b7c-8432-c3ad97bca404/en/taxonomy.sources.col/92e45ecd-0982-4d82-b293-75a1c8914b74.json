They are laterally compressed, with a single continuous dorsal fin and forked tail. Most species are diurnal and form schools on shallow temperate reefs (although some larger species are territorial and/or extend to 450 m depth). Many species change sex as they grow.</p><p>This species is fairly plump and oval, with a small head and pectoral fin longer than the head. Adult males have a slightly concave snout profile and bulge between the eyes. The mouth is small with 5 rows of incisors and no molars. Preoperculum (front part of operculum) without scales (distinguishing it from similar Blue hottentot). Colour bronze on body, head iridescent blue.</p>",
