Congregates out of water in large numbers in cracks and crevices and in any similar sheltered locations during low tide and during the heat of the day, emerging at night, or on moist days, to feed on lichens and microscopic algae on the rocks.</p><p>There is generally a size gradient within the population, with smaller individuals occurring higher on the shore to avoid severe wave action. As they grow, and are able to attach more firmly, they migrate lower on the shore, where food resources are richer.</p><p>Growth is fairly rapid, with a shell length of about 6-7 mm being attained in the first year and maximum length of about 10 mm after 3 years. Growth is slowest in winter and faster in spring or summer, probably as a result of greater food availability in the warmer months.</p><p>Can often be seen hanging from the rock surface via a sticky patch of mucus attached to the margin of the aperture, indeed may form ‘stacks’ several layers tall in this way, in an attempt to distance the body from the heat of the rocks!</p><p>At high spring tides individuals lower on the shore are often seen being consumed by the predatory dog whelk <i>Nucella dubia</i>, which grasps the periwinkle and drills a hole through its operculum, a process that takes several hours.</p>",
