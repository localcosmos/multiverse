The outer lip is thickened (unlike in cones for example) and the inner lip bears a series of distinctive ridges or pleats. There is no operculum and in live specimens the broad foot is often brightly patterned. Species identification in much more complicated, as there are a large number of often localized species (over 60 in South Africa), many with similar or variable colour patterns. Only a few of the more distinctive and common species are treated in this guide.</p><p>This small species has a cylindrical shell that has a short spire and four strongly oblique pleats on the inner lip. The colour pattern is distinctive and unusual, as there are two very different colour forms. The one form has a white shell with a single very wide central brown band and the other form has two narrow bands where the ends of the broader band would be located. The foot is pale and transparent with a few opaque white spots.</p>",
