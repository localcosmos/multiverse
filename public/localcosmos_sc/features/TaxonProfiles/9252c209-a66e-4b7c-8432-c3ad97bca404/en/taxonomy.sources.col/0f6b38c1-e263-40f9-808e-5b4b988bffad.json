Like most feather stars capable of swimming using a slow, graceful up and down movement of the arms if displaced from the reef. As the group name suggests, the arms are brittle and easily broken, but are quickly regenerated. Individuals with some shorter arms, or a reduced number of arms, are thus regularly encountered.&nbsp;</p>",

A fairly simple U-shaped gut fills most of the small body and ends in an anus that is raised on a cone close to the mouth and also on the upper surface.</p>",

The two species are most easily distinguished by the markedly different number of ventral cirri, which number 12-25 in <i>C. wahlbertii, </i>but 35-40 in<i> A. occidentalis</i>. In practice though, very few photographers turn specimens over and count their cirri, so the identity of species in many published images is suspect! It would be a valuable study to compare the distribution patterns of these two species and to determine their relative abundances, size ranges and habitat preferences (and to record the range and proportions of various arm numbers and colour forms in each species).</p>",
