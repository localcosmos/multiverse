Females typically occupying brood case with their head forward, the lateral and ventral arms bent backwards adhering to the inside of the shell, and the dorsal arms either covering the outside shell faces or retracted within. First arm pair of the female has wide distal webs that secrete the thin calcium carbonate egg case. Identification is easily done based on shell morphology. In this species the brownish white and sculptured shell is characterised by the smooth, prominent and widely spaced, lateral ribs that do not align with the large, alternating keel tubercles. The keel of the shell and the shell aperture are very wide, the latter with a width about 60–90% of aperture length.</p><p>Arm lengths and sucker counts on the arms can be consulted to identify female specimens. In this species the second arms of female are the longest with about 80–110 suckers, and the fourth arms are short with 30–50 suckers. Sucker counts on hectocotylised arms separate males of different species (37 to 44 in this species). The hectocotylus is the specialised arm of male octopuses (in argonauts the third left) that is structurally different from the others and is used to transfer sperm from to the female during mating.</p>",

            "shortText": "<p>A small, oceanic epipelagic species typically found at the ocean surface but can also occur at depths of up to 200 metres. Females build small shells as brood chambers – structures that have fascinated biologists for centuries. In the 1800s, it was believed that the animals found inside the shells were parasites that had killed the rightful shell owners. The minute male was an even greater mystery. Since the male’s specialised third left arm detaches and crawls autonomously into the female’s mantle cavity to deliver a sperm package, female argonauts often contain multiple detached arms. These were also once mistakenly identified as parasites, until the species’ extraordinary reproductive biology was understood.</p><p>Females swim slowly using jet propulsion, are usually solitary but have been observed forming schools. Due to their slow swimming, fragile shells, and lack of defensive arms, argonauts are highly vulnerable to predators. In response, they have developed several defensive strategies that include camouflaging the shell using chromatophores to create countershading. The colour varies strongly from deep maroon to silver. Inking is another defensive tactic to further disorient predators.</p><p>This species is frequently associated with gelatinous organisms such as jellyfish and salps. Divers often observe individuals clinging to the bell of a jellyfish, riding on its back – likely using it both for transport and protection. This species has also been reported to form chains of up to 20–30 individuals of the same size, each holding onto the shell of one in front, with the first individual attached to a jellyfish.</p><p>The Winged argonaut has long been divided into two groups based on the female’s shell morphology of either having winged ear-like projections (<i>A. hians</i>)<i> </i>or not having such projections (previously recognised as <i>A. boettgeri</i>). Currently, only <i>A. hians </i>is a taxonomically accepted species.<i> </i>Like other paper nautiluses, it is vulnerable to global climate change and ocean acidification could either dissolve the calcium carbonate egg case or interfere with its formation altogether.</p>",
