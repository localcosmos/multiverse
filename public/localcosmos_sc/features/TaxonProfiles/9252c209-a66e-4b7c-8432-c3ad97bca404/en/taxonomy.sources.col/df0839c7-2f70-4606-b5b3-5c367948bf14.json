The first pair of legs (gnathopod 1) bears large, powerful nippers and the second pair much smaller ones. The third and fourth pairs of legs are entirely missing and only gills are present on those body segments. Legs 5-7 are powerful, extended laterally and end in large grasping claws for clinging to the skin of their cetacean hosts.</p><p>Several species occur in the region, each distinguished largely by the form of the gills, as well as by association with particular hosts. In this species the gills each consist of two elongate ‘sausages’ with a pair of shorter crescent-shaped accessory gills at their bases. This is one of three whale louse species associated with Southern right whales.</p>",

Also in areas previously infested with whale barnacles (<i>Coronula diadema</i>). The entire life-cycle occurs on the host, with juveniles simply moving from the brood pouch of adult females directly onto the adjacent skin. Transfer between individual hosts presumably only occurs when hosts touch one another.</p><p>Genetic relationships between parasites collected from different whale populations can be used to infer how connected these populations are and suggest that Northern and Southern hemisphere populations have exchanged parasites within the past 1-2 million years.</p>",
