            "shortText": "<p>Small to medium-sized cuttlefish in intertidal and shallow waters, although specimens caught in offshore trawls are reported to be large. Mantle short and broad with convex frontal margin not strongly produced. Mantle, head and arms covered with (name-giving) large and coarse tubercles that when erect create a highly variable and adaptable texture. Tubercles in any area can be either retracted into wart-like knobs or erected into spike-like protrusions. Underside of animal smooth and without such tubercles, but with large wrinkled, glandular adhesion patches on either side of mantle and on the outer area of ventral arms. Fins wide and rounded, separated posteriorly. Arms I to III attenuated and webbed for almost half the length of arms. Tentacle club long, slightly curved, and with large suckers proximally and small suckers distally.</p><p>Cuttlebone broadly ovular without posterior spine and with a narrow inner cone. Wider and shorter than other local species, creating angled V-shape of inner cone margin.</p><p>Colour extremely variable and changes within seconds from white, yellow, orange to deep red-brown, often purple, and generally with small or larger black dots. Often makes a broad lighter mid-band on the middle third of mantle, used to break body pattern against the background. A useful species identification character that is often displayed is a small white dot on the middle of the third arm (second arm from the side). In young animals this white dot resembles the round shell of the Spiral fan-worm <i>Spirobis </i>spp.</p>",

Master of camouflage using a large suite and combination of techniques to blend into its environment that involves colour, texture, shape as well as movement.</p><p>Perhaps most astonishingly, we frequently observe small animals pointing the arms and tail while contracting the mantle to take up the shape and appearance of a <i>Burnupena </i>spp. whelk. The whelk is also matched in terms of colouration, including patches of crustose coralline algae or even the very common small white <i>Spirobis</i> spp. fan-worms. Furthermore, because Tuberculate cuttlefish have sticky, wrinkled areas on the belly and under the arms of the side, they can adhere these to the ground and or move over the substrate in the form of a whelk (or even a hermit crab?). Animals make slow backwards forward rocking movement – just like the whelk would – to stay hidden from a potential predator and secretly move into safety.</p><p>The adhesion pads on the underside are significant ecological adaptations that allow the cuttlefish to cling on to the ground and thrive in strongly wave-swept environments. The highly specialised adhesion works through both a mechanical mechanism (the muscular wrinkled patched suck onto a rock) and are also supported by a chemical two-component adhesive glue that is secreted by two different types of skin cells. Chemical adhesion is rare in cuttlefishes and the combination of this with the physical suction pads is unique to <i>S. tuberculata </i>(although the closely related but very poorly known <i>Sepia papillata </i>that has never been documented alive, seems to have the same morphological adaptations). &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Being small and as a last resort to flee from predators Tuberculate cuttlefish use a “pseudomorph”-ink (‘false body’) exit strategy. Swimming away from an attacking fish the cuttlefish releases exactly the right ink volume to match the ink-cloud to its size. It also adds high levels of mucus into the squirted ink so it takes up the form and shape of its body. The cuttlefish then uses this moment of distraction to swim into another direction, usually completely fooling the predator (or the observing diver!). Rather than being a liquid cloud the pseudopmorph ink of this species has a firm, almost fabric-like texture. Its chemical composition has however never been studied for this species.</p>",

The Pore-bellied cuttlefish <i>S. typica</i> prefers a different, sandy environment, and also has a smooth surface and different colour pattern.
