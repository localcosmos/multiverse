Ascidian larvae are famous for revealing the chordate affinities of the group, which are hard to appreciate by examining the rather degenerate-looking sedentary adults! The larvae have a distinct tail and notocord (primitive ‘backbone’) and swim actively. When they are ready to settle they attach themselves to the substratum with adhesive papillae on the head and resorb the tail and notochord, effectively rotating the body 180 degrees so that the ‘mouth’ or inhalant siphon now points upwards.</p>",
