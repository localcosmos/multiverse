Leave the colonies to feed in large flocks that fly rapidly (up to 75 km per h) low over water, often in extended V-formations, each bird gaining lift from the one in front and hence conserving energy. Often seen following shoals of pelagic fish, birds leap-frogging from the back of the group to the feeding area as the fish move forward. Settle on the sea and then plunge-diving to capture prey by pursuit-diving. &nbsp;Unusually among cormorants rests at sea between foraging bouts, the ability to do so being linked to denser plumage and greater buoyancy.</p>",
