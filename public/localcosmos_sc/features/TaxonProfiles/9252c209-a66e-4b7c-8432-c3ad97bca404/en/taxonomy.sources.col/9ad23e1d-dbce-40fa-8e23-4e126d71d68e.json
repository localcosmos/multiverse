The surface layer of the colony is densely packed with microscopic, star-shaped and protective spicules, such that the zooids beneath cannot be seen without dissection. As a result this and other didemnids are frequently mis-identified as sponges.</p><p>Colonies may be flat, or thrown into folds that fancifully represent those on the surface of the brain (hence name). The small, star-shaped inhalant siphons are evenly distributed and protrude slightly. The exhalent siphons of individual zooids pump into a common internal cavity, the water from this then existing the colony though much larger, more widely-spaced, smooth-edged and elevated openings (which can be confused with the oscula of sponges). Colour usually white, but may be grey or pinkish.</p>",
