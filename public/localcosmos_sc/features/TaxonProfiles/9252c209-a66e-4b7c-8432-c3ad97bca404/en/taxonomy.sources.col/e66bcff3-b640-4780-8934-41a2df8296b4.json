Young zooecia (towards the tips of branches) bear four long spines, two on either side of the small, round aperture, but in older individuals these are lost (or only two remain). The surfaces of older individuals are also punctured by pores. The colony bears scattered large avicularia that resemble tiny barnacles, and prominent spherical bright red ovicells may be present.</p>",
