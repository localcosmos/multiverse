There are only about 50 described species worldwide and only 4 in South Africa.</p><p>This recently discovered species was only formally named in 2017 and is currently known from only a small area extending from False Bay to Betty’s Bay in the SW Cape. It has a very short stalk and four widely spread, stiff, reddish-brown arms, each of which branches near the tips, which are armed with tufts of short tentacles. The upper surface is covered in nodular lobes (hence the allusion to pearls).</p>",
