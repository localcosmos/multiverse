Spawning is usually synchronised via hormones released with the sperm and eggs and after spawning ‘spent’ individuals are thin and flaccid. Spawning is triggered by temperature changes and in temperate areas occurs predictably in spring and sometimes also autumn. However, in South Africa sea temperatures show much more seasonal stability and spawning tends to be more irregular and is probably triggered by short-term upwelling events. The numbers of eggs produced is enormous, running to the millions per mussel and hence billions per square meter of mussel bed! Larval development takes about 30 days and juvenile mussels (spat) sometimes settle in densities of hundreds of thousands per square meter.</p><p>In this species males are more common (64%) and females (36%). The breeding season has been documented in several different areas and differs between sites (and/or years). There is usually either one extended breeding season, or two discreet events.</p>",
