            "shortText": "<p>Pycnogonids are bizarre animals sometimes referred to as ‘sea-spiders’ since both groups have four pairs of usually elongate, slender legs. However, they are not closely-related to true spiders, so we prefer the term pycnogonids. The body consists of a head with a tubular proboscis, usually a pair of grasping chelicerae and a pair of sensory palps and a pair of ovigerous legs. The latter are unique to this group and used both for grooming and, in the males, to carry the eggs. Behind the head is a usually elongate trunk consisting of four segments, each of which bears large lateral processes to which the legs are attached. At the end of the trunk is a small, usually conical, abdomen.</p><p>This unusual species has a comparatively compact body with a raised spiky ocular (eye) tubercle on the first segment, and a transverse spined ridge running across each body segment, this being armed by a central and a pair of lateral spiny knobs. The proboscis is a large tubular structure with a narrow base and is folded back under the body. There is a pair of small, clawed chelifers that extend forward from the front of the head, but the longer segmented palps typical of most pycnogonids are absent. The limbs are spinose and in live animals often coated with fine debris. The abdomen is an elongate spiked club-like spiny structure. Colour is plain cream, sometimes tinged pink. Males are often seen carrying a large oval egg mass.</p><p>The taxonomic position if this genus is uncertain so the family placement is debatable.</p>",

As the female releases her eggs these are fertilised by the male, who then gathers them up and carries them in a spherical mass attached to his ovigerous legs until they hatch.</p>",
