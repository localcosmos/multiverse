Otherwise most are small and slender.</p><p>This species has a pointed head that lacks any other appendages other than the elongated palps. The fifth segment is not swollen or otherwise modified and there are simple strap-like gills on the parapodia from segment 2 backwards. It is the most abundant worm on sandy beaches in sandy pools and in lagoonal areas, where it can attain very high densities.</p>",
