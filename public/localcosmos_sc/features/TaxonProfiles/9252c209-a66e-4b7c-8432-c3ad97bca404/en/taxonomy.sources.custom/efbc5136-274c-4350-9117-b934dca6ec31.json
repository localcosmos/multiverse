They are best known for possessing hard silica cases called ‘frustules’. Most species are solitary, but some join together to form colonial structures of various shapes, including chains ribbons, fans, stars, or even larger colonies that resemble seaweeds.</p><p>In this species the cells are rectangular and pillow-shaped and may occur singly or in chains of two to a few attached cells. The blooms form brown, slick-like scums on the water surface and are often stranded as foam-like deposits. Blooms are characteristic of long, dissipative beaches subject to strong wave action.</p>",

In the late aftenoon, they drop out of the foam and sink back to the botton, where they enter the sand. This behaviour also traps the blooms within the surf zone, as cells tend to get pushed shorewards by the breaking waves during the day and returned into the surf zone by rip currents when they sink back to the bottom in the afternoon.</p><p>The blooms are important primary producers on such beaches and sustain a whole community of associated animals.</p>",
