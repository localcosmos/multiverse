The leaves may be smooth, longitudinally grooved, hairy, or dotted with pustules and are sometimes blotched with maroon, depending on species. &nbsp;The distinctive flowers form a spike or dense cluster borne at ground level at the junction of the leaves. The petals are inconspicuous and joined for much of their length, but the stamens form a prominent upright tuft (hence the ‘hedgehog’ name).</p><p>Easily recognised to genus, but there are several similar species in the region so only a generic entry is provided. Common coastal species include <i>M. angustifolia</i> which has shiny, grooved leaves and orange stamens and <i>M. depressa,</i> which has smooth, sometimes blotched leaves and white, yellow or pinkish flowers. Both <i>M. pustuata</i> and <i>M. longipes </i>have grooved, warty leaves and white to cream flowers.</p>",
