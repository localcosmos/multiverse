Behind the palps are tufts of gills, which are usually bright red, but may be unbranched, or branched in tree-like fashion (dendritic). The body is soft, floppy and tapering and generally enclosed within a fragile, sandy tube. The segmental appendages (parapodia) are normally short ridges and are devoid of gills.</p><p>The group is very diverse, with over 40 regional species and these are hard to identify to species level, especially as the gills and tentacles have a tendency to break off if the worm is handled! This genus differs from most other coastal common genera in that the gills are un-branched.</p>",
