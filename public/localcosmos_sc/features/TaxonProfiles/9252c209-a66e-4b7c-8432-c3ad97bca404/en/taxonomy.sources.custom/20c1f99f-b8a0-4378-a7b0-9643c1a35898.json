The filaments appear segmented, but each segment is composed of many rows of small cells. Small bud-like growths may be present in the forks of the main filaments. Colour dark reddish-brown.</p><p>The taxonomy of this group in South Africa remains confused, so we do not venture to give a species name to the images provided. Species with dichotomous branching (as illustrated) were previously referred to <i>C. clavulatum,</i> but recent work by Won <i>et al.</i> (2009, 2010) failed to reveal that species, which was described from Peru, in South Africa, but instead reported several others, including some described as new, despite the study being based on examination of relatively few specimens. The true numbers of species in the region and their distributions thus remain poorly known, although a key to the known species is given by Won <i>et al.</i> (2010).</p>",
