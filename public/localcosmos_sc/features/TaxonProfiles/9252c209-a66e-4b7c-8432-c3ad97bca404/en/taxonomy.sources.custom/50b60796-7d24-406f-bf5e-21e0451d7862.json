They are best though of as colonies formed from a few types of collaborating cells. Size and colony shape is often very variable within a species and accurate identification relies largely on examining the microscopic spicules that make up the skeleton. All are filter feeders, drawing in water through small opening on the body surface, removing fine particles and ejecting the waste water from one of more larger openings called oscula.</p><p>This genus belongs to the class Calcaria, which are characterized by having elongate calcium carbonate spicules, and has a distinctive vase-like shape with a prominent ring of stiff, elongate spicules surrounding the single terminal osculum, the whole organism resembling a small, white pineapple!</p><p>There are several local species and these are difficult to distinguish from photographs, so the group is treated at genus level here.</p>",
