The usual colour is pale pinkish with small black spots, each surrounded with a while halo, but can be pure white, yellow with meandering white lines, or with larger black spots.</p>",

Also, these species are largely defined by features of the shell, which is usually concealed by the mantle in live images. To complicate matters further, mantle colour can be highly variable within species!
