            "shortText": "<p>Spiders as a group are easily identified by having the body divided into just two sections – an anterior prosoma (equivalent to a fused head and thorax) and a posterior opisthosoma or abdomen. The prosoma bears a pair of poison fangs, a pair of leg-like feelers called pedipalps and four pairs of long jointed legs. Another characteristic feature is the presence of silk glands in the abdomen. Although diverse and abundant in almost all terrestrial environments, spiders are rare in marine habitats, a few occurring in the rocky intertidal and others in and above the driftline on sandy beaches.</p><p>Wolf spiders (Family Lycosidae) are free-running, ground-living spiders. They have a characteristic eye pattern with two large posterior eyes high on the head, below which are four smaller anterior eyes. Sand-dwelling species are typically pale in colour. This species appears to be an undescribed member of the genus <i>Ocyale</i> and is off-white with a grey dorsal patch around the eyes and another larger patch dorsally on the abdomen. The anterior eyes are relatively large and arranged into a rectangle. No previous spiders of this genus have been reported from temperate parts of South Africa, although <i>O. ghost </i>is known from a sandy beach around a freshwater lake in Madagascar and <i>O. guttata</i> from inland habitats from Tanzania southwards to KwaZulu-Natal.</p>",
