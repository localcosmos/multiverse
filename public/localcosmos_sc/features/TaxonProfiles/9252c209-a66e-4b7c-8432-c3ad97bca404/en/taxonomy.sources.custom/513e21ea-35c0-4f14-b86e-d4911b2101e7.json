It is presumed here that the species described by Utevsky is indeed the same as that previously reported from this host by Day and by Branch et al. The descriptions of body form are similar, although Utevsky reports the eyes being absent in preserved specimens and these are clearly visible in the live image in Branch et al. It is common for eye pigments to disappear in alcohol though, so this is probably a function of&nbsp; the description being based only on preserved material.</p>",
