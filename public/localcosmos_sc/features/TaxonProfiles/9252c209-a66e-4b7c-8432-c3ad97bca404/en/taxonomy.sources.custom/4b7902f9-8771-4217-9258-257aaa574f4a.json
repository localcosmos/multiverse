The body thus resembles a length of bamboo. Each species has a consistent number of segments. The head in this genus is unusual, comprising a flat, oblique plate with a raised rim and no other appendages. The even more characteristic last segment is in the form of a frilly, flared funnel, within which the anus opens. There are about 10 regional species and these are difficult to distinguish from one another.</p>",
