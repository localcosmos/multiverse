Humans ingest the toxin primarily by consuming infected shellfish, such as mussels, which filter large volumes of water and concentrate the toxins within their bodies. Blooms of this species are confined to the west coast and occur most often in late summer.&nbsp;</p><p>As with other similar species, the algal blooms may cause de-oxygenation of the water, resulting in mortalities of fish and other organisms, or rock-lobster walk-outs. These occur due to oxygen depletion and are independent of any toxic effects.</p>",
