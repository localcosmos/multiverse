The colony is supported by a large inflated float with a crimped upper margin. Hanging beneath this are other zooids specialized for prey capture, feeding or reproduction. Most conspicuous are the long trailing tentacles used for prey capture and which can be extended many meters below the float, or contracted into a tight spiral. These are armed with conspicuous nematocysts which can inflict a painful sting.</p><p>Until recently all bluebottles were grouped under the one name <i>Physalia physalis, </i>but recent research has shown that there are in fact 4 species and some earlier names, including this one, have now been re-established. <i>Physalia utriculus</i> can be recognised by its relatively long, nearly un-crimped, low and even crest to the float, which has a plain blue edge and a short ‘float-tail’; by the gap between two groups of hanging zooids and by the fact that there is usually just one long major feeding tentacle. Colour is distinctive with this species having a plain blue float and tentacles, with the feeding zooids having yellow mouths.</p>",

There are both left and right-handed individuals, so these will be driven in different directions by the wind. The extremely long feeding tentacles extend far below the float and are used to capture prey swimming in the water column. The stinging cells are very venomous and can paralyse even quite large fish, which are then ‘reeled in’ by contraction of the tentacle and engulfed by feeding ‘gastrozooids’ for digestion and distribution of the nutrients among colony members.</p><p>Bluebottles can inflict painful and even dangerous stings, so should not be handled, even after they have been washed up on beaches, as the nematocysts remain potent for many hours after death. Swimming in the presence of bluebottles is also dangerous, as the extended tentacles can wrap around the body and inflict long, painful welts of stings. Despite their strong venom they are fed upon by several predators, including Sea swallow nudibranchs, plough shells and loggerhead turtles.</p>",
