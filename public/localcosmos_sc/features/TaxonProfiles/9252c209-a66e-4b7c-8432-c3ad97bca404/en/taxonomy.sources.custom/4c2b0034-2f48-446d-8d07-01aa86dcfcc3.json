They are best thought of as colonies formed from a few types of collaborating cells. Size and colony shape is often very variable within a species and accurate identification relies largely on examining the microscopic spicules that make up the skeleton. All are filter feeders, drawing in water through small opening on the body surface, removing fine particles and ejecting the waste water from one or more larger openings called oscula.</p><p>This genus belongs to the class Calcaria, which are characterized by having calcium carbonate spicules, and forms colonies that branch from a common base into distinctive elongate, white tubes that each end in a single, round, terminal osculum. The whole colony resembles a bunch of tiny bananas.</p><p>There are two described local species and probably other undescribed ones and species are difficult to distinguish from photographs, so the group is treated at genus level only here.</p>",
