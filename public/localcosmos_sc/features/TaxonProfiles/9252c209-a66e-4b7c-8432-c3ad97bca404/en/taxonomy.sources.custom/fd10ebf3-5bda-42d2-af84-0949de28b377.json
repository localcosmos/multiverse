As each animal is permanently attached to the rock the number of potential mates is limited by the length of the penis, which can be up to 3-times the diameter of the shell (relatively the longest of any animal group). The eggs are initially brooded in the mantle cavity and larvae later released. These swim and feed in the water column and go though several stages until ready to settle. Larvae are chemically attracted to older individuals, encouraging the formation of closely–packed colonies.</p>",
