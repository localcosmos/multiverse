The repeatedly branching fronds are fairly thick and cylindrical, but may be somewhat flattened towards their bases. Internally they are made up of large interwoven tubes that are each single multinucleated cells. On the surface these emerge as distinct swellings (utricles) and the shapes of these needs to be examined microscopically to distinguish between many of the species. In this species the utricles have distinctively pointed tips.</p>",
