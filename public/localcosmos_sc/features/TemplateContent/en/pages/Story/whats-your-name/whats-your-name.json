Yet the idea of what is “well-known” can be deceptive. Recently, I worked on the cephalopod group for the <strong>1001 Seaforest Species</strong> app and website, which we are developing to showcase the remarkable diversity of life in and around the Great African Seaforest. South Africa’s unique marine habitats are home to about 200 species of octopuses, cuttlefish, and squid – nearly a quarter of all the world’s cephalopod species. A few of these live in the kelp forest, and we have followed them for many years. Yet they never cease to surprise me.</p>",

We spent so much time with these animals, yet something about their identification felt strange. Following my instinct, I revisited field guides, online repositories, and taxonomic literature, but couldn’t figure it out.</p>",

They can change colour and shape in an instant, while most scientific descriptions are based on preserved specimens that have lost their colour and form. Key features used to distinguish species, such as the clubs and suckers on the tentacles, are hidden in a living animal. When these species were first described, sometimes centuries ago, biologists had no underwater cameras and were not diving. This creates a classic mismatch: the characteristics described in the literature often don’t align with our observations in the wild.</p>",

While tracking animals along the coast, we found the remains of its breakfast: a large cuttlefish, partially eaten but with the long tentacles and their clubs left behind. Several large cuttlefish live around Cape Town, and the species we often encounter in the kelp forest – the very one the otter had eaten – turned out not to be the Patchwork cuttlefish, as we had always assumed, but the Simon’s Town cuttlefish <i>Sepia simoniana</i>. This species has long tentacles lined with hundreds of tiny suckers on the clubs, which I could now see clearly for the first time. Thanks to the otter, I had the missing link, which made it possible to identify all the other pictures more confidently. I was quite shocked. All these years, we had been using the wrong name for an animal we had spent so much time with and come to know intimately.</p>",
